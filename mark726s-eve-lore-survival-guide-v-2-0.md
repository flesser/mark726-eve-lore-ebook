EVE Online: The Greatest Story Still Being Told
-----------------------------------------------

Science fiction literature has brought forth many mind-bending and
society-changing stories. From the classic novels of Jules Verne, H.G.
Wells and Aldous Huxley to the grand visions of Arthur C. Clarke, Robert
Heinlein and Philip K. Dick. Entire universes were conjured in our minds
by Asimov's Foundation series and Frank Herbert's Dune saga.

Cinema was quick to embrace the opportunity to portray the future of man
with Fritz Lang's Metropolis and eventually went on to give us the ever
growing extended universes of Lucas' Star Wars and Roddenberry's Star
Trek along with many others, both original works and adaptions of
previously written stories.

Rich futuristic civilisations have sprung forth from other sources too;
Games Workshop's dystopian Warhammer 40,000 universe and FASA
Corporation's feudal BattleTech worlds to name just two. Comics have
given us everything from Dan Dare to Judge Dredd and in recent years
digital entertainment has stepped into the arena with enduring original
storytelling like Half Life and Mass Effect.

But the future of storytelling is changing and EVE Online stands on the
frontier.

When Science-Fiction and Science-Fact Collide
---------------------------------------------

Every story mentioned above, no matter how engaging and wonderful, has
one thing in common: They were all written to be enjoyed by the
individual reader, viewer or player (or in the case of tabletop games, a
small group). EVE Online is different.

EVE Online's universe of New Eden is an epic story told on an
unprecedented scale, enacted and recorded by and for its thousands of
participants. The freeform universe engulfs the player as soon as a
character is created, fusing him into the story by simply being present
in a single-sharded science-fiction universe.

Everyone Plays a Role
---------------------

Even those participants who choose to shun the lore are still woven into
the tapestry as they select their race and bloodline, starship piloting
skills and then head off into the player-populated organisation of their
choice. Every player becomes the citizen of a galaxy seething with
politics and treachery, violence and opportunity.

The lore of EVE Online is not purely a resource for hardcore
roleplayers, it's there to be passively enjoyed by everyone with even a
passing interest in epic science fiction concepts. The themes colour the
environment in which the metagamers plot, it provides character to the
engines of mass destruction flown in huge invasion fleets and it
flavours the tactical equipment options made by every pilot.

In fact, now our entertainment is so immersive, with participants so
involved in adrenaline-pumping ship-to-ship combat, our bodies can't
differentiate between a fictional spaceship environment and a primordial
threat that triggers a fight-or-flight response. Likewise with pleasure
-- we get our dopamine hits from the digital stimuli of our pixellated
victories. Those players who furiously claim that they are not
"roleplayers" would be right in a sense; whether they are an e-sports
combat pilot, a stoic fleet commander or the "King of Space", they
aren't playing a role, they're living it.

No Wizard's Hat Required
------------------------

Yet the depth of fiction available for those who also choose a
lore-driven path of immersion is immense. With a backstory that has
grown organically over the last decade, the epic interplay of warring
civilisations in a universe of amoral, technologically-enhanced humans
can be overwhelming for the newcomer. But fear not, if your interest has
been piqued and you'd like to know how to dip your toe in the pond of
EVE lore -- or perhaps even go for a paddle -- help is at hand. I am
proud to present renowned EVE content-explorer and lorehound Mark726's
[EVE Lore Survival
Guide](http://freebooted.blogspot.com/p/fiction.html).

I approached Mark with the idea of an "EVE Lore for Dummies"-type
concept, knowing his knowledge and writing style would make him the
perfect author for such a project. What I expected was two or three
articles providing a quick insight. What I got was that and much more;
20,000 words of light, well-researched explanation that could be
presented in short, digestible chunks. I have given it pride of place on
my [Freebooted](http://freebooted.blogspot.com/) blog, but I think it
deserves to evolve into something more. I suspect Mark was hoping I'd
stop asking him stupid questions once he'd written it, but now I have a
host of new stupid questions and after reading it, I'm sure you will
too.

The Greatest Story Not Yet Told
-------------------------------

As EVE Online continues to grow and its capsuleers live the story as it
unfolds, we can only hope that the content developers at CCP have the
vision to continue to push the narrative envelope, creating content that
will ensnare and inspire.

H.G. Wells had only the written word to inspire millions and by simply
adding audio he managed to [troll a
nation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio_drama)).
Just think what is possible with a state-of-the-art server cluster, a
cast and crew of hundreds of thousands and a universe as deep and
stunning as New Eden.

Go tell Asimov, the future is happening. We're living it.

Join us...

An Introduction
===============

Hi everyone. I'm Mark726. You might know me from [EVE
Travel](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/), a blog dedicated to exploring
and explaining the various landmarks (spacemarks?) in New Eden, to aid
anyone looking to sightsee around the Cluster. Seismic Stan approached
me a while ago to ask if I was interested in writing an "EVE Lore for
Rookies" blogpost. Well, unfortunately, what originally started out as
"a blogpost" quickly mutated into this, for lack of a better term,
monstrosity.

I had originally hoped that I would be able to cover the major points in
one blog post. Indeed, in starting this Guide, Seismic Stan had
mentioned to me that people were looking for a "cohesive stream of lore"
to follow the story of EVE. After thinking about this for a while, I
came to a realization: just as in real life, there IS no cohesive stream
of lore. Rather, there are many smaller, interwoven threads of stories
that come together to create a whole. I can't explain the background of
the Minmatar without giving background on the Amarr. I can't talk about
the Jove without explaining the EVE Gate. I can't even talk about the
history of interstel ar travel without mentioning and explaining, I kid
you not, at least three major other related EVE plot points. The story
of EVE is as interwoven as it is vast.

Still, I'm not one to turn down a challenge. This guide, available here
and on [Freebooted](http://freebooted.blogspot.co.uk/p/fiction.html), is
an attempt to give a broad-ish overview of the history and lore of EVE
(a note to you professional RPers: I'd like to think that I hit the
major points in this primer, though I know I by no means hit them all.
If I left something out, it was (hopefully) an intentional decision on
my part, though feel free to argue it with me as necessary. If I got
something wrong, please let me know). Parts of the guide will be adapted
from my own blog entries, other parts will come from the so-called
"prime fiction" (direct from CCP lore, either in the form of
[Chronicles](http://community.eveonline.com/background/potw/), the
occasional book, the newly released Eve: Source, or the fantastic
[fiction portal](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Portal:EVE_Fiction)
found on the EVE wiki), and others from what must be considered
secondary sources (I would be remiss if I did not mention the fantastic
[The Hitchhiker's Guide to New
Eden](http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/Ken/The_Hitchhikers_Guide_to_New_Eden_v0.91.pdf)
by Kenreikko Valitonen). For anyone looking for more information on any
of these subjects, these will be your best places to start.

The guide will be roughly organized into five parts. In this first part,
I'll detail the deep history of New Eden, dating back practically to our
current day IRL (In Real Life), including the so-called Lost
Civilizations. The next part will look at the history of the five
empires: how they came to be, why they were created, etc, as well as the
development of CONCORD (this part is a doozy of a subject in and of
itself). Part Three (for those more interested in the yarr side of
things) will be looking at the development of the various pirate and
other smaller organizations. The fourth part will look at some of the
technology in New Eden, including the key developments of interstellar
travel, cloning, and interstellar communications, while the last section
will examine some miscellaneous items that don't quite fit anywhere
else.

So, let's get started, shall we?

In the Beginning
----------------

Let's start off with some very basic information. EVE Online takes place
(as of the posting of this blog) in the year 23,350 AD, or YC 114 (brief
sidenote: I'll return to the YC concept later on for timekeeping in the
section on miscellanea; suffice it for now to say that YC 0 corresponds
to the year 23236 AD in game terms, and that the year 2014 corresponds
to YC 116 in game.

The gameworld stretches over approximately 100 light-years, encompassing
approximately 5,000 known star systems collectively in a cluster of
stars we call New Eden (this number jumps to almost 7,500 if we include
wormhole space systems). We are completely cut off from Earth. Indeed,
it's not entirely clear that Earth even exists anymore, or if there are
any other humans out there in the universe. In terms of lore, New Eden
scientists are not even sure if a mythical place called
"[Earth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Earth)" ever existed, though
most people seem to agree that all humans have a common starting point,
even if we aren't quite clear on where that might be. We, as capsuleers,
fly throughout the stars, literally connected to our ships through
cybernetic implants and direct neural links to our ships' computers,
which makes them an extension of ourselves. Through the wonders of
cloning technology, our consciousnesses can be sent to a new body at the
moment of our body's death, meaning that we are, for all intents and
purposes, immortal.

A brief note before I move on. At times throughout these posts, I'll
make a reference to something but preface it saying that the information
isn't known in game. That's one of the things that many role players
focus on in this game: trying to solve the mysteries of New Eden. There
are quite a few things that we, out of game, know about the game
universe that the general public in New Eden doesn't know. When role
playing, its important to keep these things separate, since half the fun
of role playing for many is trying to solve these mysteries through in
game means. If you bring up this OOC knowledge, RPers will generally
politely remind you that these things may not be known. I'll do my best
to set off pretty explicitly that certain information isn't known in
game or by the general public.

For those of you who are interested in RPing, most of this next
paragraph is probably going to have to be considered off-limits to your
character (for that matter, anything prior to the soon-to-be-mentioned
Dark Ages should as a whole be considered mostly offlimits). Scientists
and researchers in the game simply know almost nothing about the early
years of the New Eden cluster, much less anything that took place before
the collapse of the EVE Gate collapsed. For those of you who don't care
and/or want to know anyway, feel free to read on, but prepared to get
shot down if you ever try to talk with someone in character (IC for
short) about these events. A more detailed look at all of this can be
found in the "official" [New Eden
timeline](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Timeline) (but as I noted,
just because it's in this timeline does not mean it's known to in-game
characters).

By the year 2730, humans had fully colonized our own solar system, which
seemed to take much longer than necessary to colonize a few chunks of
rock in one star system but whatever. It took an additional millennium
before we figured out the secrets to travelling faster than light.
Things were apparently swell for the next few thousand years, as the
timeline doesn't mention much of note, though [some
accounts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T84nrp08MWo) mention vicious
fights between corporations that control various human-colonized
systems. That began to change in [7703
AD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/EVE_gate_(Location)) when the
first known massive (supposedly) stable wormhole formed. Humans
discovered this wormhole near the system [of
Canopus](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=2505286#post2505286)
in 7987, forever changing the course of human history. The homeward side
of the wormhole was soon named ADAM while the unexplored side was given
the appropriate title of the [EVE
Gate](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2009/12/17/new-eden/). For
simplicity's sake I'll just refer to both gates as the EVE Gate (I
should note that Eve: Source seems to retcon out the fact that the Earth
side of the Gate was known as ADAM but I like it so I'm keeping it
anyway. ARTISTIC LICENSE Y'ALL). The wormhole sent explorers to a far
off system that (in a burst of genius), humans quickly named New Eden.
In a cluster (in again, a burst of genius AND creativity), they named
New Eden. Within two years, colonization of the newly discovered space
was in full swing, with the future homeworlds of the Amarr and Gallente
being purchased and colonized in 7989.

Colonization continued apace for the next few decades, spidering out
quickly from New Eden into the broader cluster. Stations, some still
seen today near New Eden (the system, not the cluster, see how brilliant
the first settlers were?), were erected to protect the first stargates.
Many planets, not all of them yet habitable, were colonized.

Those not yet habitable began being terraformed (Caldari Prime, in
Luminaire, being the most notable example of this). Few colonies were
yet self-sufficient, relying heavily on support from Earth for money and
supplies. Everything seemed to be going swimmingly.

However, problems in the EVE Gate itself soon appeared. It was not quite
as stable as the first colonists had been lead to believe. Terrans (an
umbrella term that refers to any humans that came from the other side of
the Gate) quickly began to build a device to stabilize the wormhole for
continued use. It was a massive undertaking; even 70 years later, it was
not yet done, though it did have the words
"[EVE](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/EVE_Gate)" blazoned on to it
already.

Unfortunately, the stabilizer was too little too late. On February 20,
8061, just 74 years after the wormhole's discovery, it collapsed quite
spectacularly, cutting the fledgling cluster entirely off from Earth and
its desperately needed support. The effect near the site of the gate was
absolutely devastating. Any ships nearby were completely destroyed, and
even in the modern day, the site of the Gate remains a maelstrom of
energy that [only the most dedicated
explorers](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/scientific-articles/interstellar-traveling/)
even attempt to approach. Rumor has it that the remains of Terran ships
can be found in and around the Gate, supposedly with technology far
advanced from what we have available today. The Jove (discussed a little
later in this section, but suffice it to say that they are the fifth
major, but isolated, empire of New Eden), according to that same rumor,
have cloaked the wreckage to prevent it from falling into the wrong
hands. The Jove deny it, of course, but that doesn't stop people from
looking and spreading the rumors. Beyond the immediate vicinity, the
collapse of the Gate caused malfunctions in stargates across colonized
New Eden.

The effect of the collapse of the EVE Gate on the colonies in New Eden
cannot be overstated. Despite being open to colonization for almost 75
years, many colonies were nowhere close to being self-sufficient.
Terraforming wasn't complete in many systems, and even the colonies on
habitable planets often ran into problems of food supplies and other
equipment. Many colonies simply died out from lack of supplies. Most of
the ones that survived fell into the so-called Dark Ages, reverting to
essentially feudal-level technology, reverting back to subsistence-era
technology in attempt to merely survive. Eventually, some civilizations
managed to climb back up into space... but that's getting ahead of
myself.

A Sidenote (Ancient Civilizations)
----------------------------------

Even the lore that we as players know (compared to what we would know as
characters in New Eden) isn't complete. The Dark Ages had some
interesting happenings (of which I will describe as best as possible
here), but exactly what happened after the collapse of the Gate and the
rise of the Amarr is a bit of a mystery.

What little we do know suggests that before the four major empires
arose, there were some civilizations that thrived for a time after the
collapse of the EVE Gate. For whatever reason, these civilizations
either vanished or were grossly transformed. These four "lost
civilizations" are known to us as the Sleepers, the Talocan, the Yan
Jung, and the Takmahl. Information on these civilizations is very
sparse, but I'll try to explain what I can.

The least is known about the [Yan
Jung](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Yan_Jung) and the
[Takmahl](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Takmahl). The Yan Jung
originally settled in Gallente space (conveniently, each of the four
dead civilizations just HAPPENED to settle in areas now controlled by
each of the four major empires), specifically in Deltole. According to
the scant record, they were masters of "advanced gravitronic technology
and force field theories".
[Some](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/yan-jung-ruins/)
[ruins](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/09/18/yan-jung-relic-site/)
survive to this day, including a few pieces of working technology.

The Takmahl settled in Amarr space, specifically in the Araz
constellation. They were originally members of the Amarr Empire. An
offshoot of the Sani Sabik faith (who essentially believed that drinking
human blood made you pure, with somewhat predictable results), the
Takmahl were [exiled from Amarr
space](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Sani_Sabik_Uprising)
shortly after the Empire gained interstellar travel. While many
survivors of the cult were simply sent free, a number of survivors stole
cryo-ships and ended up in Araz together. More than a little
disturbingly, the Takmahl were considered experts in "cybernetics and
bio-engineering technology." Take that how you will.

Much more is known about the
[Sleepers](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sleepers_(lore)). They
apparently originally settled in Minmatar space in the Ani
constellation. The Sleepers were [considered
masters](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sleeper_drones) of "virtual
reality, neural interfacing and cryotechnology." More interesting for
our purposes, the Sleepers were also apparently able to colonize not
only Ani, but also wormhole space (the space only accessible via
natural, but unstable, wormholes). Various active and defunct Sleeper
sites can be found throughout wormhole space (also known among the RP
crowd as Anoikis), with unmanned drones that will defend themselves as
necessary. While all of this is known to the general citizenry of New
Eden, the next paragraph contains information that is not known at all
to the general public (so not known by players when they are playing
IC), but part of the puzzle of the Sleepers have come together both in
*Templar One* and *Eve Source*.

The Sleepers were apparently once part of the Jove race. The Jove
arrived in New Eden in two parts: most of the citizenry were frozen in
cryogenic suspension and connected to each other in a computer program
(yes, just like *The Matrix*); the rest stayed unfrozen, taking care of
the ships and the frozen citizens (if any of the ships were named Zion
I'm quitting). Although most eventually did settle in New Eden, this
concept of a virtual environment remained. When the Second Jove Empire
collapsed (discussed three paragraphs below if you're THAT desperate to
learn), it appears that a faction of Jove simply returned to their
cryotubes and uploaded themselves into the Jove version of the internet.
The remnants of that faction eventually settled in Ani while the rest of
the Jove moved on to their current home, and eventually moved on to
wormhole space (how they moved there, or why, has not yet been
revealed). However, the Sleeper civilization itself is still alive, even
if they rarely leave their virtual world. They survive in their VR
construct to this day, their bodies kept in hibernation, and only very
rarely come out of their hibernation to interact with the real world
(real world in the game... you know what I mean).

The [Talocan](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Talocan) cannot really
be understood without the Sleepers. They originally settled in what is
today Caldari space, in the Okkelen constellation, and are considered to
be experts in "Spatial Manipulation and Hypereuclidean Mathematics." The
strange thing about the Talocan is that they appear to be, in some way,
connected to the Sleepers. In many of the higher classes of wormhole
space, Talocan ruins can be found interwoven with Sleeper structures.
Whether the Talocan conquered the Sleepers, or vice versa, is completely
unknown to us at this point. There is [some
evidence](http://dl.eve-files.com/media/corp/jowen/Jowen_went_to_whiskey_space.pdf)
to suggest, however, that the Sleepers and Talocan eventually joined
forces in wormhole space to fight some kind of disease. Some Sleeper
sites in wormhole space are known as quarantined sites, and will even
today broadcast warnings to stay away. The nature of the disease,
whether it still exists, and whether it affected the Talocan, Sleepers,
or both, are all matters of intense debate among the various RP groups.

The last of the original civilizations are the
[Jove](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jove). One of the original
colonists of the New Eden cluster, they survived the collapse of the EVE
Gate quite nicely, as they had come through the Gate intending to be
self-sufficient from the start, and managed to form the First Jovian
Empire after just a few centuries. While many of New Eden's colonists
were dying because of their isolation, the Jove managed to kill each
other quite a bit over their differing political and scientific views,
since the Jove are apparently a rather fractious bunch. Nonetheless, the
First Empire eventually spanned much of New Eden once they finally
managed to learn to work together for a bit. And by "a bit," I mean the
First Empire lasted [around 8,000
years](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/races/jove/). However,
no political system lasts forever, and the First Empire was no
exception. A radical faction eventually seized control, and the Empire
eventually collapsed under its own weight (warning: I'm a bit of a
political science nerd so there might be a number of sidetracks on
political theory).

About 3,000 years ago, the Jove managed to climb back to some modicum of
self-control and establish the Second Empire. But there were problems
afoot. You see, the Jove had always been pretty big into genetic and
social engineering, to the point that they had started tinkering with
our most basic human instincts. At some point, however, something went
wrong with the process. The [Jovian
Disease](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jovian_Disease) is a genetic
(in other words, non-infectious) condition where, at some point in a
Jove's adult life, they fall into an incredibly deep depression, and
eventually lose the will to live. Because the Jove are apparently
*terrible* at smal -scale genetic manipulation and limited testing, the
Disease has spread to the entire race. The Disease devastated the Second
Empire, which collapsed soon after the Disease's appearance (though it's
not clear if the Disease was the only cause of the collapse). In an
attempt to start fresh, the Jovians abandoned their original homeworld
in the region now known as
[Curse](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Curse_(Region)) about 500
years ago. The modern day Third Empire, now much smaller than the first
two, is completely isolated from the rest of the Cluster, and located in
the northeast section of the Cluster. The Jove are split into two main
factions: the Statics, who want to stop tampering with the Jove genome,
and the Modifiers, who apparently love moving those alleles around.
Beyond that, we have very little information on modern day Jove society.
We know that they're governed by something called the [Jovian
Directorate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jovian_directorate_(NPC_corporation)),
which seems to operate similarly to the Caldari's Chief Executive Panel,
but other than that, information on the Jove is incredibly scarce.
Indeed, there is at least some suggestion (through both *Templar One*
and some interactions with Sansha's Nation) that the Jove as a race
don't even exist anymore, that they've all died out from the disease.
Whether this is true or not is simply not known at this time, though
it's notable that the Jove haven't sent a delegation to CONCORD in
several years (though, to be fair to the Jove, CONCORD meetings tend to
be pretty boring so I'm not sure I can blame them).

Despite the lack of information on the Jove, they actually play a fairly
major role in the history of the Cluster. They were the ones to first
[give capsule
technology](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Jovian_Wetgrave) to
the Caldari, and eventually the other Empires. They were [instrumental
to the creation of
CONCORD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New_Eden_Historical_Overview)
a few years later, and continue to [interfere with Cluster
politics](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Theodicy_(Short_story))
when they've deemed it necessary. Despite their complete isolation (just
try getting into their space, I'll wait), they (or, someone masquerading
as them, depending on who you talk to) continues to exert a subtle, but
significant pressure on the evolution of the Cluster. They have a heavy
corporate presence through companies like Genolution and Impro, but
these are almost entirely run through intermediaries, so not even
company employees see their secret Jove overlords. They don't take a
major role in many stories in New Eden, but even here they show up an
awful lot in passing, so make sure to keep them in mind.

At this point, we've covered all of the deep background for New Eden
lore. We have yet to really touch anything that is particularly relevant
to modern day New Eden affairs, but it's all part of the tapestry of New
Eden. Next, we'll be looking at the history of the four modern empires
as well as the development of CONCORD.

The Empires
===========

In the last part, we looked at some of the deeper history of New Eden,
dating back to the discovery of New Eden itself. In this part, we're
going to be looking at something a little nearer and dearer to all of
our RPing hearts: the history of the modern day empires and their
current statuses. This is by no means intended to give you the full
breadth of information on each of the empires. It won't make you
qualified to be a talking head on a news program (you know, if there
were qualifications for that kind of thing), but it should be enough to
point you in the right direction and at least make for some witty and
charming dinnertime conversation. We'll be covering the four empires in
separate sections before turning our attentions to those lovable scamps
in CONCORD.

The Amarr Empire: God Has a Plan
--------------------------------

We start with the largest and, depending on who you talk to, most
diabolical of the four nations of New Eden: the [Amarr
Empire](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr). Two parts theological
empire, one part bureaucratic morass, with a sprinkling of lifetime
indentured servitude for just a bit flavor, the Amarr Empire is founded
on the idea that the State and the Church are one.

Thus, the [head of
state](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr_Emperor) (currently
Empress [Jamyl Sarum](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jamyl_Sarum) is
head of the church as well. As with many religions, the Amarr religion
is built on the idea that the only way to attain God's favor is through
following the Amarr path and only the Amarr path; this idea has led to a
number of "Reclaimings" throughout Amarr's history, as they try to save
the rest of the Cluster. The itty bitty, teeny weeny little footnote to
that is that the only truly "saved" people are the True Amarr; anyone
who can't trace their bloodline to the True Amarr are forced to serve
the True Amarr. And if you don't willingly serve the Chosen People, then
the Amarr will be happy to provide you room and board and work for life
in exchange for no pay and little hope of relief. Indeed, the Amarr's
slave control technology is cluster-renowned, with only the Sansha
having more effective techniques.

### History

The Amarr are notable not just for being the largest nation in New Eden
and for being slavers: they also have the singular distinction of having
the oldest recorded history, dating back almost back to the collapse of
the EVE Gate. The Amarr
[Scriptures](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Scriptures) record the
early history of the Amarr race, but like any book going on 15,000 years
old, it's entirely possible that some things may have been lost in
translation over the millennia. Still, being able to trace your history
that far back as a civilization is pretty neat.

The Amarr Empire [originally
started](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Timeline) as a split off sect
of the Unified Catholic Church of Mankind (not that they remember this).
They eventually made their way through the EVE Gate and settled on a
planet called Athra around 8000 AD. Don't recognize the name? Well, the
sect settled themselves on a portion of Athra called [Amarr
Island](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Settlement_of_Amarr_Island)
after the other colonists rejected the Amarr for their even-then crazy
religious beliefs (spoiler alert: the Amarr like to name things after
themselves). They were led by [Dano
Gheinok](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dano_Gheinok), who is
generally recognized as the first prophet of the Amarr faith (creatively
called just the Amarr faith; I think it was something in the water).

After the exile, like the other empires, the Amarr degenerated both
technologically and socially as support from Earth was cut off. The
island eventually splintered into a number of city-states who had little
contact with each other. Although the church persisted through this
time, it was rather decentralized and unable to exert much control over
the various warlord-governed factions.

The status quo was maintained for an impressive 8,000 years or so
(proving that armor ships aren't the only Amarr things that are slow and
plodding) until a guy named
[Amash-Akura](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amash-Akura) entered the
history books around [16450
AD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Foundation).
Amash-Akura was the warlord of the city-state of
[Dam-Torsad](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dam-Torsad), and he came
up with a brilliant idea: if the two driving forces of the island were
the warlords and the religions... maybe you could try combining the two
and seeing what happened? He quickly earned the approval of the Church,
such as it was at the time, and by 16470, had conquered the entirety of
the island through a combination of diplomacy and brute force. The
warlords who capitulated without violence were named Amash-Akura's
[Holders](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Holders), and the most loyal
Holders were brought together in his [Council of
Apostles](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Council_of_Apostles). The
union of church and state complete, he was crowned Emperor by the
Church, and got a fancy new [royal
symbol](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Signs_of_Faith_(Chronicle))
to boot (the story to which is actually kind of neat but this guide is
long enough already).

Under the reign of Amash-Akura, the [Scriptures
record](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ametat_and_Avetat_(Chronicle)),
that [sefrim](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sefrim) or angels,
guarded over the island, overseeing an unprecedented era of prosperity.
Even without divine (or, as some theorize, Jove) influence, the
historical records are clear that the island experienced a renaissance,
which was undoubtedly well-overdue after 8,000 years of
Civilization-type wargames. Amash-Akura allegedly reigned for about 100
years. It was around this time that
[Molok](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Molok_the_Deceiver), a member
of the Council of Apostles, attempted a coup against Amash-Akura. The
Scriptures record that the emperor requested help from the sefrim, and
when they refused, he banished them. In response, he aged all 100 years
of his reign in a single night. Many historians, however, believe that
Amash-Akura didn't reign all 100 years. Rather, he died early on, and
the Council of Apostles attempted to assume his identity, which [Molok
then tried to
expose](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Molok.27s_Rebellion).
Either way, Molok lost, Amash-Akura was either recently or long dead,
and the Empire carried on.

The rebellion, however, devastated the countryside. In order to gain
protection, many of the commoners of the island sought out Holders, and
began working the Holders' land in exchange for protection, thus proving
the feudalism was not just a Middle Ages thing. Anyway, during [this
time](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Time_of_Quiet)
the arts began making a comeback as well. Things stabilized to a nice
and quiet (dare I say slow and plodding?) pace.

After a few thousand years (I mentioned the Amarr were a tad slow,
right?), the island began to reach a critical mass; there simply was no
more room to put people. Tensions were relieved by the arrival of the
[Udorians](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Udorians) in 20022 AD.
Whereas the Amarr had settled originally (before that whole exile thing)
on the northern continent of Assimia, the Udorians had taken the two
southern continents. Free to develop technologically (i.e. without a
church to hold them down), in the 12,000 years since the collapse of the
EVE Gate, they had managed to create... boats. Not nuclear submarines,
not cruise liners, or anything, just plain old boats. Something tells me
the Athrans weren't going for a [science
victory](http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Victory_(Civ5)#Science_victory),
if you know what I mean.

Anyway, in order to keep the commoners from seeing how wonderful freedom
is when it lets you develop boats, the Emperor at the time decided to
throw them into a religious fervor. Citing Scriptures for the
proposition that the Amarr needed to convert the non-believers, the
empire launched its first
[Reclaiming](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Early_War)
against the Udorians in 20078 AD. The Amarr eventually mastered the
awesome power of boatcraft and was able to take the war to the Udorians,
who were not exactly the most cohesive and organized of people. The
Amarr began pressing captured Udorians into service in order to man the
boats (starting a long and proud tradition of slavery in the process),
and before long, the Amarr made real headway on the southern continents.
It was at this point that the Udorians decided to get their crap
together and offer a real resistance.

Bogged down in the south, the Amarr then turned their attention to the
source of their mommy issues in the first place: Assimia, the continent
from which they were originally exiled. Now filled with a variety of
tribes, the Amarr first set about with their standard Reclaiming
tactics: kill the non-believers and take them as slaves. But these
nomadic tribes were actually fascinated with the Amarr religion, and
soon the Amarr realized that they had potential allies on their hands.
In exchange for converting to the Amarr religion, the nomads would help
finish the fight with the Udorians. The nomadic tribes eventually earned
the collective nickname of
"[Khanid](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid)" or "little lords."
With their newfound Khanid allies, the Amarr eventually managed to
[finish the
conquest](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Udorian_Conquest)
of the southern continents. With the two southern continents, Amarr
Island, and much of Assimia conquered, the Amarr [consolidated their
holdings](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Time_of_Short_Calm)
instead of immediately pressing on to the heretofore unexplored eastern
hemisphere. The conquest had spurred technological innovations of all
sorts (perhaps adding the all-important "rudder" to the aforementioned
boats). During this era of consolidation, the various great houses began
to emerge, such as the Khanids and the Ardishapurs. They controlled vast
swaths of territory, and were only nominally responsible to the
then-dominant Council of Apostles. Eventually, however, there was a
hunger for more slaves, and the Amarr pressed on with their Reclaiming
of Athra. By 20544, the Amarr had conquered the rest of the planet and,
in a move that once again called Athra's water quality into question,
[renamed](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Athra_Becomes_Amarr)
it [Amarr Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr_Prime).

Within a few hundred years of conquering the planet, the Amarr had made
it into space and begun [exploring and
colonizing](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#The_Early_Years)
the rest of the system. Progress was slow, but by 21134 AD, the Amarr
were ready to look beyond their current system. Thankfully, around this
time they [stumbled
across](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Where_Do_We_Come_From.3F)
the ruins of a surprisingly well-preserved Terran stargate. They quickly
realized the promise of the new/old technology, and set about
constructing a companion gate in Hedion, the closest star to Amarr, with
the gate opening for use in 21290 AD. With the cluster now as their
oyster (that's admittedly a metaphor I've never figured out), the Empire
began spidering out from Amarr, with the Emperor soon granting the more
powerful families vast swaths of interstellar space. Around this time,
some issues cropped up with both the Equilibrium of Mankind and the Sani
Sabik, but frankly this section is already bigger than intended so we'll
just come back to them later. Just note that this is about the time that
Amarr had issues with the crazies (as opposed to all the *other* times
they dealt with crazies).

Like, you know, the crazy emperor. In 21346, Zaragram II was chosen by
the Council of Apostles to ascend to the throne. Things started off
innocuously enough, until Zaragram decided that he was the new divine
manifestation of God in the universe (as opposed to merely being God's
representative, I think. Theology confuses me sometimes). He attempted
to rewrite the Scriptures to place himself as the central figure of the
story, and even tried to build his own [City of
God](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/01/07/city-of-god/) to prove
his divinity (no this entire paragraph wasn't included to pimp my blog,
definitely not, don't be ridiculous). Thankfully, the Council of
Apostles came to see the error of their way and, in a move that surely
proved constitutionally stable, had Zaragram assassinated, founding the
[Cult of St.
Tetrimon](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Order_of_St._Tetrimon) in
the process, who continues to pop up now and then as preservers of the
"true" Amarr scriptures and general maintainers of Amarr culture.

Also during Zaragram's reign, slavery began to die out. You see, while
slavery is horrible and all, many Amarr had enough human decency to
release their slaves once a Holder felt the slave was pious enough.
Since there hadn't been much of an infusion of new blood into Amarr
society in quite some time, this meant that slavery was slowly fading as
an institution as it was becoming prohibitively expensive to acquire new
ones. Only something crazy like finding a completely new race of humans
to enslave would save the institution at this point, which of course
meant that the [Ealur were
discovered](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Discovery_of_the_Ealur)
in 21423. The Amarr, in now familiar fashion, started a Reclaiming, a
new slave population was secured, and slavery enthusiasts everywhere
breathed a sigh of relief.

A few hundred years after Zaragram's disastrous reign, Emperor Heideran
V, a Kador, decided that he too would like to make a [power
grab](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Beginnings),
it apparently being the style of the time. Alarmed and having seen this
ploy before, the Council attempted to eliminate Heideran. Unlike
Zaragram, however, Heideran was actually sane, and managed to get many
of the most powerful families on his side, including the Kor-Azor,
Ardishapur, Sarum, and Khanid (all names that should look at least
[vaguely familiar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Heir)), and began
enacting the [Moral
Reforms](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Moral_Reforms). Although
these five families were members of the Council of Apostles, they didn't
have undisputed control of the Council. After encountering resistance to
his reforms, Heideran declared the Council dissolved. Needless to say,
the Council disagreed with that assertion. And so the Empire decided to
go to war with itself. Never forced to fight technological equals
before, the two sides of the Amarr Navy initially managed to cancel each
other out. However, [after over half a
century](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Civil_War),
the Sarums and the Khanid learned the value of having actual strategic
combat, and the Emperor's side eventually won out (to be fair to the
Amarr, not much strategy is necessary when many planets had just
discovered the value of tying sharp rocks to a stick).

After the war concluded, the Emperor, along with his newly minted
[Theology](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Theology_Council) and
[Privy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Privy_Council) Councils,
finished up his Moral Reforms, bringing the Empire into the form we're
familiar with today. This involved heavy modification of the Scriptures
to hand over more power to the Emperor. The Cult of St. Tetrimon,
however, reared its head to save at least some of the original text. The
Reforms are generally regarded as ending in 21950 AD. Afterward, Amarr
[exploration](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/51st_Exploration_Corps)
continued in its slow, [plodding
pace](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Slow_Expansion).
The Ni-Kunni were discovered around this time, but given their low
technology level and willingness to embrace the Amarr faith, they were
incorporated with little difficulty.

In [22355
AD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Minmatar_Enslavement),
the Amarr ran into another small tribal culture. You've probably never
heard of that crazy tribal nation called the Minmatar. Without delving
into too much detail here, suffice it to say for now that the Minmatar
Empire spanned 3 systems at the time of discovery. The Matari were the
first species the Amarr encountered who also had attained interstellar
flight, and the Amarr held off and observed the Matari for quite a while
before beginning to skim off populations in small strikes. It took
another 125 years before the Amarr finally struck big. During a freak
storm that cut off communications across much of Pator, the Amarr
struck, lifting millions off the colonized planets in the system into
slavery. That day quickly became known as the [Day of
Darkness](http://community.eveonline.com/background/potw/default.asp?cid=jun03).
It took another 5 years, until 22485, before the Matari systems were
completely incorporated into the Empire. Having learned a few tricks
from the Ni-Kunni, the Amarr tried to entice the Matar with both honey
and vinegar. Eventually, Amarr wooing won over the
[Nefantar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nefantar) tribe, who won
much more autonomy than the other tribes in exchange for helping the
Empire find the last few free Matari holdouts.

Following the conquest of Pator and its colonies, the Empire entered
into an almost uninterrupted peace that lasted nearly 700 years. The
Empire, following the well-established axiom of "don't fix what ain't
broken" continued plodding its way slowly across the Cluster (here's a
fun game: count how many times I use "slow" and "plodding" in this
section). Unfortunately, this [era of
peace](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Era_of_Peace)
ended with the ascension of [Heideran
VII](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Heideran_VII) to the throne in
23041, which led to the Empire [losing
one](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid_Kingdom) of the 5 Heir
families. Following that, the Theology Council made the surprising move
of elevating the first Udorian family, the
[Tash-Murkon](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tash-Murkon_Family), to
Heir status. This was the first time a family of non-True Amarr ancestry
was eligible for the throne.

As you may have noticed, we're not all Amarr slaves, so at some point,
the Amarr were bound to run into someone that they couldn't Reclaim.
That happened in 23180, when an Amarr scoutship [discovered a Gallente
scoutship](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Gallente_Contact).
In my mind's eye, the event went down as two incredibly wary 10 meter
cats in space, slowly circling each other and eying each other up, which
is both terrifying and adorable at once. The Amarr blinked first,
activating a cyno, which scared off the Gallente (who hadn't seen one
before), who ran off using a warp drive, which then scared the Amarr
(who hadn't seen that before), who also ran off. I knew this cat analogy
was going to work out. ...Except the part where they initiated a
diplomatic exchange, I suppose.

Anyway, it turns out the two nations hated each other. One liked to
enslave people, and the other found that, uhh, not good. But because the
Gallente were essentially on par with the Amarr, the Empire was hesitant
to attempt what would undoubtedly be a

costly and gruesome Reclaiming, even if the Gallente were godless
heathens. Both sides realized that they could not fight one another and,
in an effort to quell simmering tensions, entered into the
[Gallente-Amarr Free Trade
Agreement](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente-Amarr_Free_Trade_Agreement)
in 23210. In a shocking turn of events, politicians gave a name to
something that wasn't entirely accurate, as the GAFTA imposed
[significant
limitations](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Gallente-Amarr_Free_Trade_Agreement)
on trade for both sides. But it was a start.

The Caldari eagerly [introduced
themselves](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Caldari_Contact)
to the Empire in 23187, hoping to find a new ally against the Gallente.
But like most overeager people trying too hard to make friends, the
Amarr ended up being put off by the Caldari (the lack of wanting to be
slaves for the rest of their lives might also have had something to do
with it).

Whereas the Caldari were overeager schoolchildren, the Jove were the
creepy loner kids. They [popped
up](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Jove_Contact)
on the Amarr border in 23191, announced that they existed, and then
left. Taking this as a sign of weakness, the Amarr set their eyes on the
Jove in 23216, being in a conquering mood at the time, and leading to
the very, very short-lived [Amarr-Jove
War](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr-Jove_War). The war
consisted primarily of the Amarr getting their butts handed to them at
the [Battle of
Vak'Atioth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Battle_of_Vak%27Atioth)
(the system, now called merely
[Atioth](http://evemaps.dotlan.net/system/Atioth), unfortunately has no
wreckage from the battle. Trust me, I've checked. Repeatedly. It-it's
kind of a sore point with me). *Templar One* suggests that the impetus
for the war was the result of some internal political strife led by
Jamyl Sarum's father.

The Minmatar, sensing opportunity, chose the Empire's defeat at
Vak'Atioth to begin their Star Warsian
[rebellion](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar_Rebellion)
against the Empire, with millions of Amarr dying in the first few days.
The Amarr were completely unprepared for a rebellion of such magnitude,
and they quickly retreated out of Minmatar space. [By the end of
23216](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Minmatar_Rebellion),
the Minmatar had claimed much of the modern day Republic, with
sympathizers among the Minmatar (primarily the Nefantar) settling into
the current day Ammatar Mandate to create a buffer zone between the two
nations.

After the rebellion, things settled down quite a bit for the Empire.
Fearing the Gallente would also take advantage of the newfound Amarr
vulnerability, Heideran (remember him?) began negotiations for a
[Caldari non-aggression
pact](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Caldari_Non-Aggression_Pact),
entered into in 23222. The assault of peace continued in 23230 when
Heideran agreed to enter into the negotiations that ultimately led to
CONCORD. Tensions [continued to
simmer](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Quafe_(Chronicle)) a bit
with the Gallente, but capitalism proved its mettle by ultimately
winning out over both sides.

Modern history of the Amarr arguably starts with the death of Heideran,
who had recently published his magnum opus on the future of New Eden,
the [Pax
Amarria](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pax_Amarria_(lore)). With
Heideran's passing in YC 105, the
[search](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Amarr_Succession)
for a new Emperor began, with [Doriam
II](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Doriam_Kor-Azor), the Kor-Azor
Heir, eventually winning out. The Doriam Imperium was [fraught with
tensions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Reign_of_Emperor_Doriam_II),
culminating with his assassination in YC 107. With the Heirs unwilling
to give up their newfound power after only two years, the Empire
collectively shrugged its shoulders and dealt with the Regency of
Doriam's court chamberlain, [Dochuta
Karsoth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dochuta_Karsoth).

Karsoth's regency was, to put it kindly, an unmitigated disaster. Heirs
[went crazy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Aritcio_Kor-Azor) and
then were born again, [Holders fought
Holders](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Amarr_Lords_and_Ladies),
and the Cult of St. Tetrimon (yes they still exist) was [allowed
back](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Tetrimon_Revival)
into the Empire.

Things culminated for the good regent in June YC 110. The
[Starkmanir](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Starkmanir), the Seventh
Tribe of Pator that was long thought to be extinct, [had recently been
discovered](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/breaking-news-large-starkmanir-slave-population-discovered-in-ammatar-consulate/)
tucked away in the Ammatar Mandate. Within a few weeks of discovery, a
massive Matari fleet, [led
by](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/report-minmatar-thukker-task-force-are-minmatar-elders/)
the Minmatar Elders and constructed in secret, [shut down
CONCORD](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/breaking-news-concord-restores-counterthreat-capability-issues-general-warning-to-cease-hostilities/)
and invaded Amarr space. The invading fleet rescued scores of the
Starkmanir, and then did what any good invading fleet should: sack and
pillage. The fleet [got as far as Sarum
Prime](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/breaking-news-massive-explosion-detected-over-mekhios/),
one jump from the Throne Worlds, when they were
[stopped](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/breaking-news-elder-fleet-over-mekhios-destroyed/)
by one [Jamyl Sarum](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jamyl_Sarum).
Sarum, one of the Five Heirs during the Doriam succession trials, had
been presumed dead due to, you know, society and millennia of tradition
demanding it of her. But apparently this all worked out for the best, as
Sarum was able to stop the invading fleet with what was apparently a
Terran superweapon (fleshed out more in *Empyrean Age*). The Amarr then
declared war on the Minmatar, starting up the faction wars (though to be
fair, just about anything, including the Amarr finding more things to
name after themselves, causes Amarr to declare war against the
Republic). With the Empire secure, the Theology Council again apparently
decided to say "screw it" to the Succession Trials, and we had ourselves
a new Empress.

Oh, and did I mention that it turns out Karsoth was really a Blood
Raider sympathizer and he got exiled and later
[executed?](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Karsoth.27s_Capture_and_Execution)
Man, you just don't get this kind of excitement in Gallente space.

The [reign of
Jamyl](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Return_and_Coronation_of_Jamyl_Sarum)
so far has seen its ups and downs. Perhaps the most notable event (and
since I'm the author I get to say what's notable) demonstrated that the
Amarr Empire, for all I make fun of them, are still capable of
semi-decent acts now and then. First off, Jamyl declared soon after
taking power that any slave of ninth generation or up was
[emancipated](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/empress-jamyl-i-makes-historic-emancipation-announcement/).
This obviously sent shockwaves throughout the Empire and Republic alike,
as the Holders hadn't exactly been consulted about losing around 800
million members of their workforce, and the Republic wasn't quite
prepared to handle 800 million new citizens. I realize this is a bit
like saying "see, they decided to kill fewer people so good for them"
but a start is a start, I suppose.

### Social Structure

The [government of the
Empire](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Amarr_Empire)
is delightfully complex, as you might have guessed, as it is essentially
a modern day feudalist structure. Each governance layer can do whatever
they want within their territories, as long as it doesn't violate
Scripture or law from higher up the chain. On the very top we have the
Emperor, who can basically do whatever the heck he (or, as the case may
be, she) wants. However, while her edicts are often unquestioned, she
only really can exert direct power over the [labyrinthine Amarrian
bureaucracy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Imperial_Ministries)
when present in person to see that something is carried out (it turns
out that Amarr never learned its lessons from
[Trantor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor)). Below the Emperor sits
the rump of the Council of Apostles, the [Privy
Council](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Privy_Council). The various
Heirs have a seat at the Council table, as do the heads of the various
ministries, as well as the [Court
Chamberlain](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Court_Chamberlain), who
can often act as the voice of the Emperor. Speaking of the Heirs, each
governs a portion of the Empire (with either the region they rule or the
home planet generally being named after the various Heirs, in a
continuing display of Amarr humility). The five Heir families are the
[Ardishapurs](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ardishapur_Family),
[Kadors](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kador_Family),
[Tash-Murkons](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tash-Murkon_Family),
[Kor-Azors](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kor-Azor_Family), and
[Sarums](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sarum_Family). The current
Heirs are [Yonis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Yonis_Ardishapur),
[Uriam](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Uriam_Kador),
[Catiz](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Catiz_Tash-Murkon),
[Aritcio](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Aritcio_Kor-Azor), and
[Merimeth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Merimeth_Sarum),
respectively. The Khanids have also been granted a seat by Empress Jamyl
in light of the Kingdom's recent rapprochement with the Empire.
Alongside the Privy Council is the [Theology
Council](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Theology_Council), which acts
as the final determiner of what the Scriptures say. Alongside this
responsibility is the maintenance of the [Book of
Records](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Book_of_Records): a nearly
uninterrupted genealogy of the Empire dating back to Amash-Akura's time.
An Amarr citizen being stricken from the Book is one of the gravest
punishments that exists (beyond, you know, death). Below the Heirs,
[Holders](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Holders) of various
significance often control the nitty-gritty details of local governance.

A few notes about the Emperor. First off, Emperors are chosen by the
[Succession Trials](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr_Succession),
which have their roots in the Scriptures 2.0 (The Scripturing) that came
into place following the Moral Reforms. The Trials pit the five Heirs
(or, in more recent years, Heir-appointed Champions) against each other
in a series of tests designed to see who most holds God's favor in
becoming the next Emperor. The winner takes the Throne, while the
losers, in an attempt to keep them from usurping said Throne, must
commit [Shathol'Syn](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Shathol%27Syn):
ritual suicide (continuing the Amarr's reputation as a Super Cheery
Bunch). Scandal the First rocked Jamyl's reign when people realized that
she had gotten around Shathol'Syn by having herself cloned as a
capsuleer. The Empire (with the exception of the traditionalists who
were hushed up by Jamyl's supporters) col ectively shrugged its
shoulders at this shocking breach of tradition, though. Secondly, the
Emperor must follow the [Doctrine of Sacred
Flesh](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sacred_Flesh), which
practically speaking means that the Emperor's body must be kept pure:
i.e., no cloning. Scandal the Second rocked Jamyl's reign when people
realized that she had gotten around Shathol'Syn by having herself cloned
as a capsuleer. The Empire continued to collectively shrug its shoulders
at this shocking breach of tradition, with a firm but apathetic "meh."

Anyway, below the Holders, we reach the
[commoners](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Wealthy_Commoners),
or middle class of the Empire, and then everyone's favorites, the
slaves, who hold the approximate political rights of a toadstool (though
with perhaps somewhat better housing options). As you might expect, the
Empire is pretty regimented by class. It might surprise you to learn,
however, that the Empire is [surprisingly
diverse](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Ethnicities),
ethnically speaking. Though the majority are [True
Amarr](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/True_Amarr), the Minmatar
tribes and others take up a significant chunk as well (and not just as
slaves!).

### Roleplaying Tips

Before I dig in to a few tips for RPing the Amarr, I just want to
mention something for the aspiring RPers out there. In these sections,
I'll be mentioning some broad guidelines that MOST RPers try to adhere
to in playing their characters in a respective background. But that
being said, just as in real life, you can find all kinds of people in
the Empires. Just because I might say that the Amarr are super
religious, doesn't mean they ALL are. Feel free to go against the grain
or go with it, I'm just trying to offer some hints if you're interested.

Those of you looking to RP an Amarr character should find it pretty
easy. Broadly, there's two categories of Amarr characters: those who
honestly believe in the Amarr religion and will work to Reclaim other
people, and those who really don't believe in the religion but pretend
to for greater personal gain (there is some suggestion in *Templar One*
that even Empress Jamyl fal s into this latter category). Regardless of
personal motivations, Amarrians (Amarr? There's no clear distinction in
the literature either way and I use the terms interchangeably) are
generally seen as haughty and, as could be expected, rather
holier-than-thou. [True
Amarr](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/True_Amarr) suffer the most
from this type of condition, of course, since they are God's Chosen
People. What little is known about the
[Ni-Kunni](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ni-Kunni) suggests that
they have long been absorbed by the Empire and accept their place, even
if it is near the low rungs of the Empire's society. The
[Khanid](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid_(bloodline)) are a
bit unique in that some of the race has split off into the Khanid
Kingdom, but a significant chunk of the bloodline remains Imperial
subjects. In general, the RP crowd tends to split amongst Royal Houses
rather than the formal bloodlines. There are varying degrees of how
dedicated to the faith a person is, how much they accept Jamyl's rule,
and how much sympathy they feel for slaves and former slaves. That said,
Amarr also tend to be friendly towards the Caldari (apparently in an
"enemy of my enemy is my friend" type approach), solidified [by economic
ties](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari-Amarr_Economic_Stimulus_Agreement).

The Minmatar Republic: 7 Tribes for 7 Brothers
----------------------------------------------

It shouldn't be surprising that the history of the [Minmatar
Republic](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar_Republic) is
intimately interwoven with the history of the Amarr (unless you've been
living under a rock, or, you know, not reading the section before this).
While the Minmatar are a rich culture in their own right, of course, the
brutal enslavement for centuries left an indelible mark on their
society, and in many ways still dictates how the Republic and individual
Minmatar react to many situations. Currently headed by
[Sanmatar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sanmatar) [Maleatu
Shakor](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Maleatu_Shakor), the Republic
is really only a Republic in name, given that Shakor disbanded the
Republic Parliament when he came to power a few years back, though he is
attempting to constitute a more representative tribal council. This has
done little to affect the temperament of the Republic, however, and the
Minmatar remain a [deeply spiritual
people](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Ray_of_Matar), dedicated
to their tribes and their Elders. The Minmatar consist of seven
different tribes, each now united and represented in some way in the
Republic: the
[Thukkers](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Thukker_Tribe), the
[Brutors](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Brutor_tribe), the
[Nefantar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nefantar), the
[Starkmanir](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Starkmanir), the
[Sebiestor](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sebiestor_tribe), the
[Krusual](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Krusual_tribe), and the
[Vherokior](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Vherokior_tribe).

### History

The deep history of the Minmatar is a bit more hidden than the Amarr's.
We know that Pator, the Matari home system ('Matari' and 'Minmatar,'
like 'Amarr' and 'Amarrian,' are fairly interchangeable, with no
definitive usage rules coming out of the literature, although
preferences do vary), was settled around 8017 AD and quickly developed
due to Matar's (Pator IV's) hospitable climate. From there, we jump
right through past the Dark Ages (yadda yadda yadda intertribal warfare,
mystic beliefs, etc), to when the Minmatar formed a global government,
about 200 years before the Amarr managed to conquer the entire planet.
The Minmatar also quickly re-entered space only about a century after
the Amarr did. However, the stargates in Pator were much better
preserved than in Amarr: instead of needing to build their own, they
were able to use the ones still built, quickly colonizing three
different star systems.

Then came the Amarr. As noted, the Amarr encountered the Minmatar in
22355. For the next 125 years, the Amarr would raid Minmatar worlds for
slaves. Then, in 22480, the Day of Darkness arrived, when the Amarr
completely conquered the Matari homeworlds (amusingly, Eve Source gets
this date wrong but I verified it with CCP because I am a THOROUGH
RESEARCHER and don't nobody tell me otherwise). The Matari quickly
formed their own resistance groups during the Occupation, to varying
degrees of success. This required the Amarr to develop more and more
effective means of controlling their massive slave populations (the main
modern technique, Vitoc, will be discussed in Part 4). Given that the
Matari were the largest civilization to date absorbed by the Empire, it
was no surprise that they had trouble completely maintaining order.
However, they did manage to attract some Matari to their side. Most
notably, the Nefantar tribe adopted the Amarrian religion en masse and
came to be seen as the Empire's closest allies among the tribes. This
meant that the Amarr invested heavily in Nefantar space (now known as
the Ani constellation), and that the Nefantar reaped the rewards. Other
tribes did not fare nearly as well. Internal political schisms within
the Empire (and a few plucky rebels) eventually lead to the annihilation
of the [Starkmanir
homeworld](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Starkman_Prime). It was
assumed at the time that this led to the loss of the entire Starkmanir
tribe, and is generally seen as one of the pivotal causes of the
[Rebellion](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Minmatar_Rebellion) 250
years later.

The end of the Occupation, as mentioned above, began after the [Battle
of Vak'Atioth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Battle_of_Vak%27Atioth)
in 23216. The Minmatar, sensing weakness after the Amarrian's resounding
defeat, quickly seized the opportunity to throw off their master's yoke,
as well as exile the Nefantar (who eventually became known as the
Ammatar) for their role in aiding and abetting the Amarr both prior to
and during the Rebellion. Finally, over 730 years after the Day of
Darkness, the Matari claimed Pator as their own. The Federation heavily
supported the Matari rebels from the beginning. Although they didn't
directly intervene with military force, Gallente materiel and support
was crucial to allowing the Matari to reclaim what they had lost and
quickly establishing a working government.

Recent history has proven just as interesting for the Republic. For
obvious reasons, tensions are still high between the Republic and the
Empire. These tensions came to a head during the [Elder Invasion of YC
110](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Year_YC110#The_Minmatar_Fleet).
The Elders were, until quite recently, taken as the mythical head of the
Minmatar prior to the Day of Darkness. They proved to be quite real when
they led a combined fleet of secretly built capital and subcapital ships
into Amarr space. Precisely who or what the Elders are, and how they fit
into Tribal culture, has never been entirely explained. It seems that
the Elders withdrew from the Tribes around the time of the Day of
Darkness, biding their time to allow a triumphant return, but there are
[also
indications](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Theodicy_(Short_story))
that they kept an eye on the Tribes, and might even have some mystical
powers. Suffice it to say, though, that they are greatly revered by the
Republic as a whole, even moreso now after their invasion of Amarr
space. First, they managed to completely destroy CONCORD's rapid
response capability (after [testing their abilities
first](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCVyU4RbFEg),) and then invaded
Amarr space. They also managed to free many recently-discovered
survivors of the Starkmanir tribe in Ammatar space (the Ammatar's
interesting background will be discussed in Part 3), and wiped out the
defensive fleets surrounding the Kor-Azor homeworld. They would have
done the same in Sarum Prime if not for the return of Empress Jamyl and
her aforementioned superweapon. Since being stopped in Sarum Prime,
however, the Elders seem to have disappeared again and have not been in
the news since.

Since the Elder Invasion, Matari society has undergone significant
upheaval. [Karin
Midular](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Karin_Midular), former prime
minister of the Republic, was assassinated at a Gallente cultural
festival. Midular [eventually
died](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/karin-midular-has-died/),
but more importantly, her death served to drive a wedge between the
Gallente and the Republic. The Federation insisted on prosecuting the
shooter, a Gallente national, before extraditing him to the Republic.
Though [Gerne
Broteau](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/midular-shooter-identified-appears-in-court/)
was [found
guilty](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/grene-broteau-found-guilty-on-all-counts-republic-demands-extradition/)
by Federation courts, the Republic was furious that the Federation
waited so long to turn over the shooter, and he was pretty much
summarily executed once the Republic finally got a hold of him. Since
then, a number of
[stories](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/federation-minmatar-report-widespread-discrimination/)
have come to light demonstrating that despite the Federation's
long-touted tolerance, Gallente of Minmatar origin suffer discrimination
inside Gallente space (BREAKING: humans generally dislike people who are
different from them; details at 11).

### Social Structure

The loyalties of a Minmatar are first and foremost to a Matari's tribe.
The tribe determines much of a person's beliefs and the rituals he or
she adheres to. Within a tribe, organization can get a bit... jumbled.
Tribes tend to break down into varieties of clans, which in turn are
comprised of various families that have similar backgrounds. Clans tend
to be a bit specialized. Another social structure in the republic is
known as one's circles, which can be thought of as a kind of workers'
guild (anyone who has read the Wheel of Time series can think of all of
this as very Aiel-like; I keep waiting for a reference to a car'a'carn
but it hasn't happened.... YET).

One of the key features of becoming an adult in Minmatar society is the
acquisition of a special tattoo through the ritual [of
Voluval](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Voluval). The tattoo gained
through this process is said to determine one's future, and [certain
symbols](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Ray_of_Matar) from the
ritual can mark certain people as having a great destiny.

Although they have the largest numerical population of the major races
with something like 24 trillion Matari spread across New Eden (possibly
in sardine-tin-can type conditions if Eve: Source's numbers are to be
believed, but that's another discussion ENTIRELY), the Matari are very
spread out. A full 20% of Matari have emigrated to the Federation, while
almost a third of the 7 tribes are still enslaved by the Amarr. Even
those that remain in the Republic are often not tied down, and vast
Thukker caravans are known to roam the Great Wildlands.

Inter-tribe tensions can also at times reach a head, especially in the
modern day. As noted above, the Republic recently received a huge influx
of Starkmanir tribesmen, and they are having trouble integrating within
the Republic, as are the Thukker tribesman who have decided to settle
down in recent days. Furthermore, the same Elder invasion that rescued
the Starkmanir also resulted in a large number of Nefantar returning to
the homeworlds after a long absence. Given their tribe's history, they
are often shunned from the greater Republic polity, and their
integration into the Republic is ongoing.

The tribes each have different traits. The Sebestiors are valued for
their intellect and engineering prowess. The Brutors, as their name
might suggest, are among the more disciplined and militaristic of the
tribes. The Krusual are much more secretive and far more adept at the
political game. The Thukkers, as noted above, are much more nomadic and
able to rely much more on their judgment and instinct in emergency
situations. The Nefantar and Starkmanir have only recently returned to
the flock, and other than troubles integrating have not really
distinguished themselves as of yet. Eve Source delves into the various
Tribes for anyone interested in learning more. This guide is long enough
as it is.

Religion and spirituality play a large role in Minmatar life as well,
though perhaps not as large of one as you might find in the Empire. As
best as I can discern, Minmatar spirituality revolves around the idea
that each Tribe has its own 'First Elder,' or spirit, that embodies the
various traits that each Tribe is known for. Each tribe appoints its own
tribal Elder that is supposed to be the living embodiment of that
Tribe's spirit, and maintain the knowledge accumulated by that Tribe
over the mil ennia. It's important to note here that these elders are
probably, but not definitively, the same Elders that led the Amarr
invasion back in YC 110. How we got from "spiritual leader" to "leading
a massive and awesome looking fleet that took on CONCORD and the Amarr
and only lost because of a massive superweapon" is anyone's guess at
this point.

Matari governance has undergone significant changes in the recent past.
Although the Matari used to adhere to a Gallente-endorsed parliamentary
form of government, the Republic, led by Sanmatar [Maleatu
Shakor](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Maleatu_Shakor), has changed
the government to make it much more Matari in nature. Though the tribes
are now self-governing, nation-wide legislation is enacted by the Tribal
Council, which for all intents and purposes maintains complete control
over the Republic. The Sanmatar acts as head of state, and presides over
the Council, but otherwise wields few non-emergency powers. The Republic
Parliament must have pissed someone off back in the day, as they've been
reduced to a very much a rump role in the new Republic 2.0. The
Parliament now acts as a sort of drafting committee for the Council.
Whenever the Council is feeling lazy and doesn't want to deal with a
problem on its own, it can delegate the problem to the Parliament to
draft legislation, though the Council needs to approve it first before
becoming law. The Council has full power to enact, veto, amend, spit on,
curse, or otherwise override anything the Parliament does. As I said,
Parliament pissed someone off something fierce back in the day.

### Roleplaying Tips

As might be expected, the Matari are seen mainly as the rebels,
especially against the Amarr. They're often played off as
anti-establishment, sometimes just for the sake of being
anti-establishment. Although many RPers these days choose to have some
direct connection with slavery (either by being recently escaped slaves
themselves, or the children of slaves), this is apparently changing
somewhat. Although there are still strong anti-Amarr feelings throughout
the Republic, some are choosing to play themselves as only more
distantly or abstractly aware of slavery and its Amarr connection. As
with most things in RP, of course, there's a broad spectrum of how to
play your characters and how anti-Amarr you'd like to be.

As I mentioned above, a Matari's loyalties is first and foremost to his
or her tribe in most cases. The Matari have a bit of an awkward
situation in that only 3 of the 7 tribes (the Sebestior, the Vherokior,
and the Brutors) are actually playable in game. To make up for that,
some choose to have some connection to the other tribes (the most
notable one probably being the nomadic Thukkers). Another important
aspect of a Matari identity is their tattoos (which they receive through
the Voluval ritual) and their piercings. It shouldn't be too surprising
either that they tend to be fairly friendly to the Gallente as well, but
as noted above, the relationship between the two has become rather
strained in recent months.

The Gallente Federation: Or, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Amarr Empire fancies itself as the moral center of New Eden, the
[Gallente
Federation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente_Federation) (for
those who want to be technical (or just snobby), it's the Federated
Union of Gallente Prime) is surely the cultural one. A nation where
anything goes, as long as it makes you happy (and doesn't hurt anyone
else), the Gallente pride themselves on being at the forefront of New
Eden's culture, fashion, and philosophy. Your beloved author admits that
he finds some difficulty in describing the Gallente, if only because
they're so incredibly individualistic that outside of the fact that they
all decided to live near each other and hey maybe they vote together
sometimes too, it's remarkably difficult to find the true definition of
"Gallente" these days. That, and the ridiculous complicated
kind-of-like-the-United-States federalism-to-the-max government
(currently led by President of [Jacus
Roden](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jacus_Roden), of [Roden
Shipyards](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Roden_Shipyards) fame), but
that's another matter entirely. Suffice it to say that the Gallente
pride themselves on their freedom, their individuality, and their
ability to get basically any drugs, sex, or media that they could
possibly want at any time. I'm pretty sure that's the definition of a
devout Amarr's nightmare, which MIGHT go a long way toward explaining
why the two don't always see eye to eye. But I'm getting ahead of
myself. The Federation is made up of races from across New Eden (most
notably, many Minmatar who chose not to join the Republic, who comprise
about 1/3 of the Federation's total population), but the principal
members are the [ethnic
Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente_(bloodline)),
the spiritual [Intaki](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki), the
regimental [Jin-Mei](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jin-Mei), and the
rather nationalistic [Mannar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mannar).

### History

Gallentean history (though not known by New Eden denizens, of course)
dates back to well before the collapse of the EVE Gate. [Gallente
Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente_Prime), originally
known as the 6th planet in system VH-451, was purchased for settlement
by French colonists from the system of Tau Ceti (it's weird seeing a
real place in New Eden history). The French proudly carried on their
history of liberty, equality, and brotherhood through the Dark Ages.
Gallente Prime itself was (and still is) a very hospitable planet,
meaning that they made it through the Dark Ages with little to no
problems.

Though some records exist [of early Gallente
history](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/History_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Age_of_the_Ancients)
(which incorporates your standard "ahh we had tribal people and we
fought sometimes and yadda yadda yadda" early history stuff), the rise
of the
[Rouvenors](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/History_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Age_of_Rouvenor)
is considered by most historians to be the true beginning of Gallente
society (I'm basing that on the very reputable fact that the rise of the
Rouvenors is when the Gallente wiki starts to actually care about silly
things like dates and places).The Rouvenors arose from a small kingdom
in the middle of the continent of Garoun, from a city known as Cylle
(known in the modern day as
[Caille](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caille)). With plentiful food
and room to grow, the Garoun Empire soon expanded across the globe. And
then the empire made what most historians consider A Mistake: They
discovered human rights and junk. People started to think that MAYBE
ruling by monarchy through one family line wasn't the smartest idea in
the world. Shortly thereafter, the empire began to collapse as states
split away in the name of self- determination. Though the empire
collapsed to a mere shadow of its former glory, it persists to this day,
and the Rouvenors are still revered as the founders and nurturers of
modern liberal philosophy.

The Gallente then entered its [industrial
age](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/History_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Age_of_Industrialization),
which is really only notable for the fact that the Gallente went
[steampunk](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/History_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Airship_Revolution)
for a little while (yes, CCP, I totally caught that). Throughout this
era, however, the planet continued to nurture this funny little idea
that government by the people was the best way to go. Anyway, the
Gallente then went full bore through the atomic and [information
ages](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/History_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#The_Information_Age),
with a brief interlude of tripolar hegemony that basically devolved into
everyone deciding that they should sing Kumbaya around the campfire and
trade instead of fighting. It should be noted that while everyone loved
one another, apparently, the entire planet was still divided into a
multitude of nations, though most shared the ideas that individuality
and democracy are pretty awesome. The most notable developments here
were two-fold: the formation of the World Democracy League (CCP's
thought process here apparently being, "Hey, what can we call the United
Nations without calling it the United Nations?"), and, near the end of
the information age (inventing the internet apparently being [a
thing](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/History_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#The_Information_Age)),
the discovery that oh, hey, people live on the next planet over.

The [discovery of the
Caldari](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nascent_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Caldari_Contact)
in 22463 AD understandably shook the Gallente to the core. An
International Space Cooperative was formed shortly thereafter, which
organized robotic probe missions to what would soon be known as Caldari
Prime. The Caldari, originally baffled by the shiny metal things fal ing
from the sky (they were mid-industrial age at the time), eventually
figured out that someone was going to go all ET on them soon, and first
contact occurred 54 years after the Gallente first discovered the
Caldari. And the peasants rejoiced, especially when the Gallente started
catching the Caldari up on 200 years of technological development.
Within 80 years of first contact, the two planets began building
stargates (a bit behind the Amarr due to the fact that the gates in
Luminaire were [less well
preserved](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Where_Do_We_Come_From.3F)).

In a turn of events that might be shocking only to people who have lived
under a rock in New Eden, however, tensions quickly arose between the
sister worlds. Given the substantial handicaps the Caldari faced on
Caldari Prime, it should be little surprise that the Caldari population
was significantly smaller than the Gallente. And then the Caldari
learned the thing that sucks in democracies: being a permanent minority.
You see, the ISC and WDL were still around, with the ISC in particular
governing colonization programs. And both operated on almost purely
democratic principles, meaning that the significantly less populous
Caldari were consistently outvoted by the significantly more populous
Gallente. Although many took this in stride, a small minority felt that
this marked the beginning of the end of Caldari culture (spoiler alert:
they don't always stay a minority). This fear was NOT helped by the
appearance of something called the [Cultural Deliverance
Society](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nascent_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Cultural_Deliverance),
which while benign on the surface, sought to overthrow some of the more
hostile Caldari governments.

It turns out the ISC wasn't always the smartest. Despite the fact that
two groups of humans just HAPPENED to pop up on two planets in one star
system, they were completely blindsided by the concept that humans would
be found outside Luminaire: in this case, [the
Intaki](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nascent_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Intaki_Discovery).
In a brilliant display of ingenuity worthy of a clichÃ© '80s film, the
crew of the *Sojourner* decided to go native for a year to learn about
the Intaki. They liked what they saw, and eventually, the newly formed
Office for Foreign Planetary Development sent a second ship to establish
more permanent relations with the various Intaki tribes, as well as to
start modernizing their planet. They took to this a lot better than the
Caldari did, and quickly embraced Gallente technology and ideas.

Shortly thereafter, the Luminarians (I sadly can't call them the
Federation yet and I'm left with *that* monstrosity of a name for them)
also ran into [the
Mannar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nascent_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Mannar_Expedition),
which were a bit farther along in the technological development area.
Although the Gallente were eager to establish contact, they ran into a
small problem: there was no planetary government and they still had this
weird thing called "war" going on (although their predilection for
near-nudity endeared them to the more exhibitionist Gallente, they were
a bit more turned off by the continued use of human sacrifice). You see,
the Mannar weren't the entire race: they're only one nation on a planet
with a multitude of them (not to mention the biggest), and the various
countries didn't particularly like each other (slave raids will do that
to a people, as the Amarr learned). So the Gallente did what any
civilized planet would do: gave technology to the non-Mannar nations on
the planet. The Gallente were shocked -- SHOCKED I SAY -- to see that
the other nations then used their new-found technology to invade Mannar.
For somewhat unexplained reasons, the Gallente public still preferred
the Mannar over the non-human-sacrificing nations, and the
newly-developed Sotiyo-Urbaata drive, i.e. the warp drive we all know
and love, allowed the Gallente to impose their glorious open-mindedness
on the planet, forcing peace onto the planet.

By now, the Intaki had coalesced into a global governmental power, and
soon started joining the various Gallente-based organizations. The
Mannar ended up establishing a global hegemony on their world, and times
were just grand. Economies were booming, people were happy. It was
around this time that the Gallente elite decided that they weren't quite
rich enough. They began lobbying governments to form a new
inter-planetary organization based on the concepts of free trade (CCP
apparently deciding that it likes egging on the WTO conspiracy
theorists), and soon the Gallente-biased [Multi-World Agreement on
Trade](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nascent_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#The_Fourth_Agreement)
was formed. This allowed Gallente power brokers to keep control over the
new colonies popping up all over the place, as well as those pesky
Caldari. But the economies continued to boom so no one really cared.
Soon, however, after the WDL teamed up with the ICS in implementing the
MWAT while still controlling the ISC, everyone decided that the acronyms
were just getting stupid at this point. And so, in 23121, over the
reluctance of the still-pouty Caldari, the Federated Union of Gallente
Prime was born.

Originally, the Federation operated solely under the province of the
[Federation
Charter](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Federation_Charter),
which established the basic structure of the government. At that time,
the Federation acted more as a parliamentary body than the more
presidential-style government we see in action today (whoops, there's my
poli sci geekery getting the better of me). Early Federation government
was concerned with getting itself set up. Outside of consolidating
power, the biggest thing of note during the early years was the passage
of the [Aclan
Agreement](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Aclan_Agreement), which
required direct Senate intervention before any Federation corporation
was allowed to tamper with a planet's ecosystem. That agreement, the
hallmark of modern environmentalism, remains in force to this day.
However, the Federation initially had major issues coordinating
reactions without any way to communicate in real time. Interstellar
policy is a harsh mistress, and the days or weeks that were needed for
any official Federal response was often fatal to Federation initiatives.
It would remain this for the next 25 years, until the FTL communication
was discovered by scientist Li Azbel (I discuss the basics of the tech
in section 5).

With FTL communications, the Gallente quickly acted like the cultural
overlords that they are and established a media empire that spanned the
cluster. They quickly took over the... space... waves... (or something)
and before you know it, they'd apparently made it to the [era of 24-hour
news
channels](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Democracy_goes_Faster-than-Light)
that had nothing better to fill their time with than fluff pieces and
soft news stories (I'M NOT EVEN MAKING THIS UP YOU GUYS). Anyway, it
turns out that the 49th story on the plight of the poor from Luminaire
made people fed up enough to demand some basic human rights. And so, in
addition to the federal Charter, a federal
[Constitution](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Federation_Constitution)
was drafted that granted basic human rights such as freedom of
expression, thought, etc.

Oh, and 23149, the [Jove introduced
themselves](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Jove_Conspiracies)
to the federal government, but everyone kept it hush hush. With
predictable results, conspiracy theories soon flourished.

Oh, and it turns out the Caldari were still pissed off. They had
continued to establish their secret colonies because they [resented
Gallente
domination](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Early_Days_(Chronicle)).
Whoops. And those [colonies were
discovered](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Sobaseki.27s_Sedition).
Double whoops. While this action was technically legal, tensions rose
even further on the technicality that none of the newly discovered
colonies had representative governments. The Caldari used this to
conveniently announce that neither did they: the megacorporations now
spoke for the Caldari people. Triple whoops. Things were getting
awkward. And the best way to handle awkwardness is clearly to have an
ultra-right wing party come to power, and within days, the Senate was
demanding that the Caldari submit the colonies to federal authority and
establish democratic governments.

In response to the demand, the Caldari walked out of the Senate and the
[Caldari
seceded](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Caldari_Secession)
from the Federation. The Federation responded by blockading Caldari
Prime. Things stalemated from there, with each side being frozen by not
being sure just how far they really wanted to push things. A Caldari
splinter group took care of THAT little obstacle by
[attacking](http://community.eveonline.com/background/potw/default.asp?cid=24-11-08)
the Gallente underwater city of [Nouvelle
Rouvenor](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nouvelle_Rouvenor) on
Caldari Prime. The attack killed 500,000 mostly Gallente citizens.
Though the Caldari State disavowed the actions, they did little to crack
down on the organizers.

As is normally the case in democracies after such a shocking attack,
backlash in the Federation was [quick and
harsh](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Breakout_(Chronicle)).
The Ultra-Nationalists quickly took power after the attack. For the
first and only time in Federation history, the Charter and Constitution
were
[suspended](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#The_Caldari_Breakout)
as the military imposed martial law. However, both sides were
surprisingly well matched. The Caldari couldn't break out of Caldari
Prime, while the Federation made little headway in calming the
insurrection (or dealing with
[protests](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Intaki_Protests)
on other worlds; martial law is a fickle mistress). Things changed as
once again, the Caldari struck in a surprise attack. Knowing that the
Caldari would need time to fully evacuate the planet and that the
Gallente military had been severely shaken up by the right-wing
government that came to power, one Caldari Admiral set out to distract
the Gallente enough to allow for an evacuation. Starting a massive game
of cat and mouse, [Admiral
Tovil-Toba](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Yakiya_Tovil-Toba) bought
the time necessary for the Caldari megacorps to evacuate the civilian
population. Finally, when Tovil-Toba's ship was broken and wrecked from
the week spent leading the Gallente fleet on, he sent his ship, a
full-fledged carrier, crashing down onto Gallente Prime. The ship landed
on the Gallente city [of
Heuromont](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hueromont), killing over 2
million. Admiral Tovil-Toba is revered to this day by the Caldari for
his assistance in freeing his people. If I had to guess, I'd say he
wasn't quite as well-loved on Gallente Prime.

After Heuromont, the Gallente realized that MAYBE revoking basic
liberties wasn't the way to solve a crisis that basically started by not
allowing people enough freedom. The right-wing government was swept
away, and the new president introduced [significant
reforms](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Yiona.27s_Reform)
to the Charter and Constitution. The reforms brought the current
three-branch system of government that we all know and love.
Furthermore, the *de jure* capital was moved from Gallente Prime to
Villore (with the *hideously* named Libertopolis being made the capital
planet) to show that the Gallente were not meant to dominate the
Federation. Oddly enough, they didn't quite notice that "Gallente" was
in the name of the Federation, a fact that baffles experts to this day.
Anyway, the new president,
[Yiona](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Luminate_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Yiona.27s_Revolution),
saw to the re-establishment of the rule of law in the Federation, and
basically did her best to clean up the mess of the ultra-right-wingers.

The Caldari war of secession continued on for a number of years, with [a
few
detours](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Harner_Doctrine)
here and there. Despite the fact that the Hueromont attack threw the
right-wing government from power in the Federation, peace was not yet to
be found. The Gallente were just too hurt by the attack to forgive and
forget in attempts to make peace. Rather, with the Caldari now
established in their own proper space, the [war once again
came](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_War_Drones_On_(Chronicle))
to a standstill, with neither side really gaining a permanent advantage.
The Gallente fleet was based on large, lumbering ships, so the Caldari
developed a fleet of single-man fighters. The
[fighters](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Fighter) took a heavy toll
on Gallente ships, so the Gallente responded by developing the first set
of [drones](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Drone), an area where the
Gallente lead technologically even to this day. In response to drones,
the Caldari re-invented the wheel, apparently, by stumbling upon the
idea of using frigates as anti-drone platforms. At this point, the
climactic battle of the war occurred in Iyen-Oursta; a 15-hour slugfest
that resulted in both sides being able to say they won in some fashion.
The Gallente held the system, but the Caldari lost fewer ships. After
that, the war settled into a stalemate, and eventually ended in more of
a whimper than a bang when the still-new CONCORD negotiated a truce
between the two parties in 23248 AD. The Caldari were allowed to secede,
but the Caldari in turn recognized that maybe having your capital planet
in the middle of enemy territory wasn't the smartest thing in the world,
and so they gave up their claim to Caldari Prime (Spoiler alert: not
really).

But that's not to say that the war consumed all of the Federation's
attention. Near the midpoint of the war, a Mannar exploration vessel
[stumbled
across](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Diyichu_.28Jin-Mei_First_Contact.29)
the Jin-Mei. The Jin-Mei were a culture unlike others they'd seen
heretofore; despite being relatively advanced (to the point that they
were able to field basic military space vessels), they maintained a
strictly regimented, caste-based society. Despite the fact that the
Federation required all member worlds to have a democracy-based system
of government, the Jin-Mei were eventually allowed to join the
Federation and simply opt out of those pesky "equality" rules
(apparently the Federation was [Canadian
based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notwithstanding_clause), who knew?
Ok, seriously, I'm done with the poli sci geekery).

But by far the most notable event in the middling civil war era was the
[discovery of the Amarr
Empire](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Amarr_Revelation),
which ended up triggering a kind of [identity
crisis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Culture_shock)
for the Federation. You see, the Federation had, since its founding,
seen itself as the grand union of all humanity. It united all people
peaceful y, spreading democracy and free trade through the cluster. And
then, suddenly, it wasn't the only representative of humanity out there.
Indeed, it wasn't even the *largest*. The Amarr Empire was more
populous, stronger, and practiced slavery. And it most certainly was NOT
democratic. It took a while for the Federation to re-orient itself
towards the idea that it wasn't just a grand union: it was a government
just like the other major powers (it's this re-orientation that I think
made the Gallente more willing to accept the Caldari peace accords
eventually, since the Caldari would no longer be the only humans outside
the Federation, but that's just my own pet theory). Anyway, trade
relations [were eventually
opened](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Opening_of_trade_relations)
with the Empire, and the two powers found themselves in an uneasy truce,
with neither willing to challenge each other directly.

*Indirectly*, however, the Gallente were [all over
it](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Minmatar_Rebellion).
The plight of the enslaved Minmatar quickly became well known throughout
the Federation, and significant chunks of the electorate felt that
something needed to be done to take the yoke from their backs. And after
the setback for the Amarr at Vak'Atioth, the Gallente eagerly pitched in
to help with the new Rebellion. The advantages for the Federation were
two-fold: first, they had a genuine interest in eradicating slavery (yet
couldn't commit to a full-scale war while still at war with the
Caldari). Secondly, the Federation was eager to knock the Amarr back as
a matter of morale for a Federation that was still re-adjusting to not
being the only human government in existence. So the Gallente, along
with the Jove, coordinated supply runs to help the Rebellion. While the
Federation never officially acknowledged their role, the Federation
press secretary might as well have been actually winking at the camera
whenever someone asked about it.

As we all know at this point, the rebellion ended up succeeding. Given
the heavy support that the Federation provided, you might have expected
the newly formed Republic to join the Federation. But many saw this as
simply impractical, both because the Federation could not afford the
massive reconstruction effort (either in money or in manpower... that
whole "Caldari War" thing was still going, you know) and they didn't
want to risk antagonizing the Amarr more than they already had. So while
the Federation and Republic grew to be close allies, they remained
distinct governments.

As the Caldari War dragged on in to later years, more and more of the
younger generations began clamoring for peace. They had not been around
for the horrors of Hueromont and Nouvelle Rouvenor; they just wanted
this war to be over with. In fact, they wanted all war to be over with.
The Federation had originally been formed to allow all humanity to air
its grievances in a civilized fashion... if the Federation itself had
failed in this task, might a new organization succeed better? The leader
of the movement was a young Senator (and later, Federation President)
named [Aidonis
Elabon](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Aidonis_Elabon). The [fruits
of his
labor](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Foundation_of_CONCORD),
of course, was CONCORD, and he somehow managed to get all the empires to
sign on to the idea. Capsuleers and pirates have retroactively cursed
his name ever since.

Since then, the Gallente have actually had few notable incidents (at
least, incidents that aren't covered elsewhere in this guide). A
[few](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Theodicy_(Short_story))
[flare-ups](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Girani-Fa_incident) with
the Amarr occurred, as did a few attempts to set up [permanent
collaborations](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Crielere) with the
Caldari, neither of which resulted in anything particularly major
(unless you count, you know, cloaking devices major). However, tensions
came to a head again with the Caldari in YC 110. The Gallente, upon
invitation to talks with the Ishukone megacorporation, sent one of their
[most-respected naval
officers](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Alexander_Noir) as
representative to Malkalen. The naval officer ended up going rogue, and
[crashing his Nyx-class supercarrier into the
station](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSHdIsIOrsc), killing 420,000 as
well as Ishukone's CEO (The novel *Empyrean Age* clarifies that a person
known as [the Broker](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Broker) had
actually replaced the admiral to sabotage his reputation before killing
him, but of course this is not known in an IC context). This acts as the
catalyst needed to restart the Caldari-Gallente war.

Perhaps the most notable development in recent times for the Gallente
are the steps the government has taken to crack down on civil liberties
in some areas. President Foiritan's first major step in that direction
was the very [public
execution](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Souro_Foiritan#The_execution_of_Anvent_Eturrer)
of a Gallente defector, [Admiral
Eturrer](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Anvent_Eturrer), in full view
of the public. The President also saw the creation of the [Black
Eagles](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Black_Eagles), headed by
former political rival [Mentas
Blaque](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mentas_Blaque), as a secret
policing branch of the government, overseeing internal surveillance as
well as acting as the secret ops branch of military intelligence.
President Roden has seen no need to interfere with the Eagles since
coming to office in YC 111.

### Social Structure

As you might have guessed from the introduction, the [Federation
government](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation)
should be familiar to any student of American government (I know I
promised the poli sci geekery would end, but like most politicians, I
LIED). You have the standard three branches (though the wiki somewhat
adorably adds [the
bureaucracy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Bureaucratic)
as a fourth branch) --
[executive](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Executive)
(headed by the Federation President),
[legislative](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Legislative)
(the unicameral Senate, with 903 members from 62 districts), and
[judicial](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Judicial)
(headed by the Supreme Court) -- all of whom serve to check and balance
each other to prevent any one branch from aggregating too much power.
Each district (usually, a constellation) has its own district parliament
that serves in an advisory capacity. Below THAT are the various member
states. These are not just states in the American sense, however. These
are fully fledged nations. The federal government primarily concerns
itself with free trade, peaceful expansion for member states, and
promotion of [democratic
governance](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Democracy_in_the_Gallente_Federation).
Additionally, the [Federation
Constitution](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Federation_Constitution)
guarantees a variety of rights such as freedom of expression, equality
before the law, and the right to human dignity. Anything that isn't
explicitly laid out in the Federation Charter or Constitution are left
to the member states to sort out. Additional y, certain governments
(notably, the Jin-Mei) are granted the power to opt out of certain
provisions of federal law (rights? We don't need no stinkin' human
rights). The wiki entry on Gallente government will tell you all you
ever wanted to know and more on various aspects of Gallente governance,
including how [a
colony](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Colonies)
becomes a member state, the
[jurisdiction](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Authorities)
of various governmental authorities, and even the [types of
laws](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Government_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Laws)
that the Federation has (and if you want minutiae OVER 9000, check out
the article on [classification of
cities](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Gallente_Federation#City_grading_system)).

[Culturally
speaking](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Culture_of_the_ethnic_Gallente),
the Gallente are just as varied as a society based on the [celebration
of the
individual](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Society_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Individualism)
would suggest. The Gallente love for finer aspects of life are
well-earned; the Gallente are well known for their food, fashion, and
[ability to have a good
time](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Society_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Leisure).
And given that the Federation is the melting pot of the Cluster, it
shouldn't surprise you to learn that its rather difficult to classify
anyone based on their racial backgrounds. Not only have almost all of
the various races in New Eden found their way to the Federation at this
point, but they've also interbred to a significant degree. Those looking
to classify Gallente citizens in ANY way are more likely to find success
by looking at a person's ideology than their racial background. Indeed,
that is the biggest identifier of the various [voter
blocs](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente#Voter_Blocs) in
Gallente politics (along with an odd, but appreciated obsession with
various birds).

That being said, there are a few primary ethnic groups to be found in
the Federation. The [ethnic
Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gallente_(bloodline))
take the stereotypical Federation love of all things individual and
liberty to the extreme. Beyond them are the Mannar, who [rival the
ethnic
Gallente](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Culture_of_the_ethnic_Gallente#Influences_and_proliferation)
when it comes to fashion expertise and trend setting, but are also known
for their fierce nationalism and determination. They were the primary
source of recruits in the Caldari civil war. The Jin-Mei are a bit of an
outlier. In a nation that is renowned for its dedication to democracy
and equality, the Jin-Mei maintain a strict caste-based system. Although
the caste-system, under the agreements that the Jin-Mei made when it
ascended to Federation membership, is not allowed outside of the
Lirsautton system, the system still operates in full force within
Jin-Mei society due to [Federation
concessions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Ascension).
Oh, and then there's the Intaki. But they're special enough to warrant
an entire section (and NOT just because my character happens to be one).

### Roleplaying Tips

As you could probably guess, the Gallente like to, shall we say, "party
hard." They are known for their, well, sex, drugs, and rock and roll,
and most Gallente are proud of that fact. They also tend to be the most
idealistic of the four races, frowning mightily from their ivory towers
on the Amarr for their slave-holding ways and the Caldari for their
unenlightened secession and subsequent war. They even can (though by no
means do all people do this) look a little patronizingly on the
Minmatar. Haughty might even be an appropriate term for the
"stereotypical Gallente," and it's an oft-repeated criticism of the
Gallente that they believe their culture is the best and wish to gobble
up all the others. Gallente by nature tend to be nosy and opinionated,
and while their desire to "civilize" or "uplift" societies to Gallente
standards may stem from good intentions (most of the time), it's
backfired enough times to be clear that it's not always the right
answer. But that doesn't stop people from trying anyway. Many RPers tend
to have a pet cause or causes to get worked up about. Gallente can also
be the rather stereotypical hippies; indeed, there's a large
environmental movement, hints of which can be seen in the Gallente
COSMOS constellation in Algintal. Oh, and I should mention that there is
a rather vibrant Intaki secession movement in some parts of the RP
community. Some feel that the Intaki get short shrift (especially since
Intaki Prime, the homeworld, is in the faction warfare zone between
Caldari and Federation space and actually sat in Caldari hands for a
good chunk of time back in the day), and would be better off striking
out on their own. This is a continuing debate though, and I don't
believe there's a clear majority one way or another.

The Caldari State: Nothing Says Love Like a Giant and Soulless Megacorporation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If it's difficult to describe the Minmatar without referring to the
Amarr, it is impossible to describe the [Caldari
State](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari) without describing the
massive impact the Gallente Federation has had on it. Having developed
in the same system as the Gallente, the State was born in blood and
fire, through their determination to not be governed by anyone. Any
description of the Caldari as a people have to start and end with the
concept [of
megacorporations:](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari#Megacorporations)
gargantuan corporate entities that control a person's life from cradle
to grave. A person lives and dies by the grace of his corporate masters.
In some respects, though, this has lead to an even more equalitarian
society than even the Gallente: the harsh realities of darwinian
economics and corporate bottom lines have made the State an almost ideal
version of a meritocracy, where anyone can make it far if they have the
talent and are willing to work at it. Although there have been some
attempts to centralize authority in the State in the recent past, the
eight megacorporations still firmly control the levers of power within
Caldari borders.

### History

The early history of the State has made a lasting impact on the Caldari,
moreso than the other races. The planet that would eventually be known
as [Caldari Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Prime) was
purchased by a megacorporation in 7993. Caldari Prime, unlike its sister
Gallente Prime, was a harsh and cold world. Indeed, heavy terraforming
would be needed to make it habitable, and the terraforming had only just
begun when the EVE Gate collapsed. It would take another 250 years
before the surface was habitable, and even then the air was thin and the
soil fairly barren. Despite the harshness of the only minimally
terraformed world, the Caldari managed to eke out an existence in the
temperate regions near the equator. This harsh history ultimately lead
to the Caldari's well-known utilitarianism, and profound belief in the
idea that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few (making
Vulcan proud in the process). The Caldari didn't care how pretty
something looked, it would kill you all the same if it didn't do
something to help the people survive. Though they were never
particularly centralized, the most notable of the nations that manage to
rise on this cold and dreary world was the Raata Empire, which united
the Tikiona continent in 17453 AD. The Empire survived for over 3,500
years before col apsing in 20998 AD. The myriad smaller states that
followed in the Empire's wake eventually ended up organizing primarily
around ethnic lines, with little cross-ethnic mingling.

This was essentially the state that the Caldari were in when first
contact was made with the Gallente. I should probably note here that the
term "Caldari" wasn't really in use prior to first contact with the
Gallente (so sorry for lying to you above!). Rather, the term came in to
use to distinguish the two homeworlds in Luminaire. I should also note
that the evolution from traditional government to corporatocracy remains
largely unexplored; frankly, CCP has never really delved into the
subject in-depth (ironically, or perhaps fittingly, what little
exploration into the subject is done through Gallente wiki entries).
It's implied at times that the old government was too Gallente-friendly,
and that it was only the megacorporations -- strangled by Gallente
interests -- that were willing to take a stand. But just how the
megacorporations seized control, and the resulting culture shocks that
reverberated throughout Caldari society, remain one of the great
unexplored mysteries in Eve.

Anyway, rather than rehashing the history of the Gallente-Caldari War
again, I only want to touch on a few things about the impetus for the
war from the Caldari's perspective. To understand the desire to secede,
one has to understand that the Gallente were seen as, for lack of a
better word, rather meddling. Almost from the beginning, the Gallente
seemed to enjoy lording their sophistication over the Caldari, a culture
that prided itself on its self-sufficiency, perhaps best epitomized
through the fact that something called the '[Cultural Deliverance
Society](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Cultural_Deliverance_Society)'
existed in the first place (though, fittingly, the CDS did [introduce
the concept of
"corporations"](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nascent_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Cultural_Deliverance)
to the Caldari in the first place... maybe Star Trek is something is on
to something with that whole 'Prime Directive' nonsense...). Although
information on the Society is somewhat sparse, given the name it
wouldn't be a stretch of the imagination to say that it probably had the
purpose of "civilizing" the Caldari. From there, the situation continued
to worsen as the Gallente dragged the Caldari (essentially kicking and
screaming) through the formation of the Federation. By then, the
megacorporations had begun to assert themselves as the primary governing
body of the Caldari, and they did not appreciate the regulations and
rules the Federation put in place on them, again bumping up against that
Caldari pride in self-sufficiency. It seemed that everywhere they
turned, the Federation was ready to gobble them up. The Federation
trying to assert jurisdiction over the hidden colonies was simply the
straw that broke the camel's back, and things spiraled from there.
Meddling lead to anger which lead to Nouvelle Rouvenor which lead to the
blockade which lead to Hueromont. Neither party and both parties are at
fault for the lead up to the war; it was just a situation where
societies just don't mesh well with one another.

More recent history has been rather eventful for the Caldari. Starting
in YC 110, a worker named Tibus Heth rose to national prominence after
rising quickly from factory worker to CEO [of Caldari
Constructions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Constructions).
After the aforementioned [Malkalen
incident](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Malkalen_catastrophe), Tibus
was able to use the nationalist fervor to get himself appointed head of
the newly formed Caldari Providence Directorate, essentially taking
direct command over much of the Caldari State. This was an unprecedented
consolidation of power when the megacorporations were known to have
almost unilateral authority in many areas. Heth has changed this
dynamic, getting de facto dictatorial powers over much of the State. He
has used these powers to, among other things, gear up for another war
with the Gallente and, more benevolently, re-establish the meritocracy
that some felt had gotten lost in recent years.

After taking power, Heth was able to leverage the Elder fleet invasion
to his own advantage. In a [daring lightning
strike](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Year_YC110#The_Caldari_Invasion),
Heth used the failure of CONCORD's rapid response capabilities (and with
help from Admiral Eterrur, who sabotaged the Federation's early warning
systems) to sweep through
[Algogille](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/03/02/algogille-graveyard/)
(the headquarters of the Federation Navy) and
[Luminaire](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/luminaire-graveyard/)
to retake control of Caldari Prime. President Foiritan had little choice
but to cede the planet back to the Caldari after he found

Luminaire blockaded and 20 million troops landed on the surface of
Caldari Prime. The Caldari quickly took control of the planet and showed
the flag by leaving *Shiigeru*, a [Leviathan-class
titan](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/03/13/luminaire-titan-2/), in
orbit of the planet. This titan was eventually brought down in rather
spectacular fashion, [leaving nothing but smoldering
ruins](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/operation-highlander-battleground/)
and a demilitarized Caldari Prime.

After losing *Shiigeru*, Heth reacted to the devastating strategic loss
of leverage over the Gallente with poise and aplomb by immediately
forcing the Admiral commanding the ship (a capsuleer) to [commit
ritualistic
suicide](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/breaking-news-yanala-forced-into-tea-maker-ceremony/).
You know, as galactic leaders do. Once the news of this broke, Heth's
reign quickly spiraled downwards. Most of the Caldari mega-corporations
had grown tired of Heth's centralization, and yearned for a return to
the prior status quo. The news of the Tea Maker Ceremony (leave it to
the Caldari to make ritualistic suicide sound like an afternoon with
grandma) was the impetus the megacorps needed to boot Heth. Within a few
days, Heth was on the run. First, he and his remaining followers [seized

He was removed as CEO of Caldari Construction, and there are now
[warrants out for his

Heth's current whereabouts are unknown, but given that his lungs are
[slowly turning into lumps of
coal](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tibus_Heth#Health), we'll
probably be hearing about his death soon enough.

### Social Structure

A person's daily life in the State begins and ends with one of the eight
megacorporations:
[Sukuuvesta](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sukuuvestaa_Corporation),
[Nugoeihuvi](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nugoeihuvi_Corporation),
[CBD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CBD_Corporation),
[Ishukone](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ishukone_Corporation),
[Hyasyoda](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hyasyoda_Corporation),
[Kaalakiota](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kaalakiota_Corporation),
[Wiyrkomi](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Wiyrkomi_Corporation), and
[Lai Dai](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Lai_Dai_Corporation). These
megacorps, through a nightmarish maze of subsidiaries, affiliates, and
other corporate mumbo jumbo, owns something like 90% of all property
within the State. Although the corporations each have their own agendas
and ideologies, they generally fall into one of three philosophical
blocs: the
[Practicals](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Corporate_Factions#Practicals)
(consisting of Sukuuvesta, Nugoeihuvi, and CBD, whom are generally the
most exploitative and the most supportive of Heth), the
[Liberals](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Corporate_Factions#Liberals)
(Ishukone and Hyasyoda, whom generally are the most supportive of free
trade and cordial relations with other nations), and the
[Patriots](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Corporate_Factions#Patriots)
(consisting of Kaalakiota, Wiyrkomi, and Lai Dai. This faction is by far
the most powerful, and advocates putting Caldari interests above all
else; they're known for their fierce nationalism). A fourth faction, the
Provists, had risen as Heth's primary power bloc before he, umm, went
crazy. Needless to say, they're pretty much out of the picture with
Heth's downfall, though he still has loyalists scattered throughout the
State. However, all the blocs tend to be united by a martial pride;
although it is the smallest of the four empires, the State often leads
in military technology and strategy, allowing them to stay on par with
the other empires.

Traditionally, like the Matari tribes, the corporations are given
extensive leeway to conduct their own business and affairs as they saw
fit. Individual megacorporations run their own schools, have their own
currencies (indeed, the Caldari financial system is so complex as to
warrant two extensive
[wiki](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Caldari_Financial_System)
[entries](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Funds_Unlimited) and
their own justice systems. Each megacorp even has their own police force
and military. A contract between megacorporations is considered almost
sacred: only the quasi-judicial [Caldari Business
Tribunal](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Business_Tribunal)
has authority to cancel contracts. The CBT isn't a traditional Supreme
Court, however. It's only meant to settle disputes between the
megacorps, even if they have extensive powers at their disposal to do
so. For most traditional crimes and legal appeals, the megacorporation's
own justice system is the first and last stop. Any executive action is
exercised jointly by the megacorps through the [Chief Executive
Panel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Chief_Executive_Panel), with
each megacorp having a seat at the table. The CEP is what sets the
national budget as well as runs the State's military apparatus (not to
be confused with the individual corporate militaries).

Heth had attempted to centralize power in the State and remove much of
freedom to act that the megacorps had previously enjoyed. For quite a
while, the CEP was reduced to essentially a rubber stamp, blindly
approving any and all of Heth's reforms with minimal modification, given
his popularity with the Caldari masses. The one true outlier in the new
system was Ishukone. Prior to former CEO [Otro
Gariushi's](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Otro_Gariushi) death,
Ishukone was the leading corporation pushing for peace with the other
Empires. They even managed to develop an antidote for Vitoc (explained
in Part 4, but essentially the drug the Amarr use to help control
slaves) which they were willing to give to the Minmatar. Even after
Gariushi's death, his replacement as CEO refused to be cowed by Heth (as
detailed in *Templar One*). With Heth out of the picture, however, the
previous status quo is quickly reasserting itself.

Bloodlines tend to play an odd role within the State. Although
meritocratic in nature much of the time, an odd strain of racial purity
runs through some aspects of the corporate Caldari culture; indeed, one
of the factors that controls whom a Caldari may marry (as determined by
the aforementioned corporate overlords) is similarity in physical
appearance. The megacorps are trying to maintain the Caldari 'look'
across the generations. As such, a look at the various bloodlines is a
necessity. First there is the
[Deteis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Deteis), who are seen as
hard-working and efficient. Often the face of Caldari leadership, they
truly believe in society-above-self. The
[Civire](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Civire) tend to be quick
thinkers, and handle themselves well under pressure. They seem to
genuinely enjoy being constantly busy, and they always strive for excel
ence. Finally, and as a bit of an outlier, we have the
[Achura](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Achura). Unlike the Deteis
and the Civire, the Achura were not a founding member of the State, but
were absorbed about 300 years ago, and they followed the Caldari in
their secession from the Federation. Spirituality appears to feature
more prominently in Achura life, but unfortunately the [details of the
main
religion](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Achura#The_Celestial_Imperative)
appear scant in the literature. Suffice it to say that the Achura are
more introverted than the others, but more renowned for their
intelligence.

### Roleplaying Tips

The Caldari are probably best known for being fiercely nationalistic,
and proud both of their state and their parent corporation. Given that
the corporation has essentially raised their members since birth, their
views on various affairs are likely to closely match their parent
corporation when it comes to foreign affairs or Tibus Heth. The Caldari
are also fiercely proud of their meritocratic system, and tend to look
harshly upon slackers or those who do not pull their weight. Although
clearly highly disciplined, the Caldari, like everyone, need to let off
steam now and then, and the State enjoys a thriving gambling and sport
culture. Finally, they tend to be fairly utilitarian, caring little for
how something looks if it's able to get the job done. They tend to
mirror the Amarrian's view of their alliance: it's more one of
convenience than of any particular ideological similarities, as is their
view of the Minmatar. Obviously, their hatred for most things Gallente
can be well-explained given their history.

CONCORD: Policeman of the Skies
-------------------------------

[CONCORD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD), short for
CONsolidated COoperation and Relations commanD (they were stretching a
bit, but frankly let's just be glad that the Amarr didn't somehow name
it AMARR), was [originally the
brainchild](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Modern_Era_of_the_Gallente_Federation#Foundation_of_CONCORD)
of a young Gallente senator named
[Aidonis](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Aidonis_Elabon), with heavy
and discreet backing from the Jove. Devised as a way for the empires to
maintain the peace, CONCORD was given broad authority over many
interstellar affairs. CONCORD is charged with maintaining the status quo
between the various empires. Perhaps the most useful tool in CONCORD's
possession in the pursuit of this mandate is Directive [Alpha-Gamma
12](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/eve-online-news/concord-releases-core-complexion-technology/),
which allows CONCORD to seize any technology that could alter the
strategic balance, and auction it off to the highest bidder in each of
the other three empires (AG 12 strikes again, though not by name, in
*Templar One* with the newly developed mercenary technology). CONCORD's
secondary mission is to keep us rambunctious capsuleers in check. To
that extent, the [Jove have equipped
CONCORD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Storylines_of_New_Eden_-_11th_February)
ships with specialized weaponry that prove far more deadly to capsuleer
vessels than they do to regular vessels. Their specialized weaponry
keeps pod pilots in check (at least theoretically), while also keeping
CONCORD from growing too big for its britches, so to speak.

Originally formed in 23233, no one was originally sure what CONCORD
would do with its new found powers. It took a while for it to get into
its stride. Indeed, it wasn't until 15 years later, when it negotiated
the end of the Caldari-Gallente War, that anyone really took it
seriously. From there, it slowly grew its base of support, and today it
is self-sufficient from the taxes it earns from capsuleer transactions
(those wonderful sales taxes we must all pay) and other revenue. Indeed,
CONCORD no longer needs to rely at all on the empires for financial
support, and it has used this newfound independence to [advance its own
agenda](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD_Assembly) independent
of the empires.

[CONCORD](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD_(NPC_corporation))
is headed by the [Inner
Circle](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Inner_Circle), consisting of a
delegate from each nation and the five department heads in CONCORD. The
Inner Circle appears to hold significant sovereignty over the empires:
after the YC 110 attacks, the various empires were unable to form
capsuleer-controlled militias until CONCORD
[passed](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Dark_End_of_Space_(Chronicle))
the [Emergency Militia War Powers
Act](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/CONCORD_Emergency_Militia_War_Powers_Act).
From there, CONCORD breaks down into a number of divisions. The most
well-known to the capsuleers would be the [Directive Enforcement
Division](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/DED): they're the ones who
blow you up when committing a CONCORDable offense in space, acting as
the policemen of the stars and protecting many a pilot in high security
space (I know, I know CONCORD doesn't protect, it punishes, yadda yadda
yadda). They have special tools and weapons from the Jove that only
affect capsuleer ships. The other agency that us capsuleers have the
most direct interaction with is the [Secure Commerce
Commission](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Secure_Commerce_Commission):
they're the ones that take your taxes and regulate trade between the
empires.

Frontier Organizations
======================

*Minor Powers, Mighty Aspirations*

For most video game companies, the four major empires, with their
expansive backstories, would have been quite enough for their content
teams. They could rest on their laurels for a job well done and some
information to put in their tiny instruction manuals (remember back in
the day when they gave a ton of background? I miss that), and carry on
with their lives. Fortunately for us canon geeks, CCP is NOT like most
video game companies. Beyond the four major empires, the Jove, and
CONCORD, there are a rich number of smaller factions that, while you
can't necessarily play them as a bloodline, fill in more of the tapestry
of New Eden (and let people get their yarr on in quite a few different
ways). I won't be spending nearly as much time on these smal er powers
as I did for the major empires, but each of these have their own unique
storylines that deserve at least some mention.

Ammatar Mandate
---------------

I've actually mentioned the
[Ammatar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ammatar) before in the
sections on the Amarr and Minmatar. Originally known as the
[Nefantar](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nefantar), they were the
only Minmatar tribe to accept the Amarr invasion with something like
open arms. Indeed, this was something of a political decision made by
the heads of the tribe to ensure the Nefantar's survival. Eventually,
the rest of the tribe came to embrace the Amarr way of life, including
their religion. The Amarr, eager to promote such views, lavished money
and
[gifts](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2012/01/29/the-reactor-factory/)
on the tribe in their home constellation of Ani, while savaging the
tribes who were less, shall we say, multicultural in that respect. The
contemporary Amarr emperor even granted the Nefantar limited autonomy
over Ani. This led to a somewhat inevitable schism between it and the
rest of the tribes.

But all was not well between the Amarr and the Nefantar, at least in the
higher levels. The largest break came when the Amarr [bombarded Starkman
Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Starkmanir#Under_Amarr_Rule)
into ash. Even the Nefantar couldn't take such a direct assault on one
of the Tribes. And so they began one of the greatest cover ups in New
Eden history. Almost all known Starkmanir slaves were transferred to
Nefantar authority through either forged documents or coercion, hiding
the remnants of the tribe in plain sight. It was by no means a perfect
solution, but it was the best possible under the circumstances. But, of
course, the Nefantar leadership couldn't exactly brag about their
accomplishment. Although they apparently had the blessings of the
Minmatar Elders, one of the greatest rescue missions in known history
had to remain a secret for hundreds of years. The Ammatar leadership now
claim that rescuing the Nefantar was their primary reason for siding
with the Amarr during the Rebellion, but given the strength of pro-Amarr
feelings even prior to the Starkman apocalypse, that explanation has a
bit of a "revisionist history" feel to it.

During those hundreds of years, of course, the rest of the tribes
rebelled and pushed out the Amarr from their space, along with their
apparent lackeys, the Nefantar. The Amarr, in consideration of the
support received even during the Rebellion, granted the wayward tribe
some space (conveniently, and completely coincidentally I'm sure,
located to act as a buffer zone between the newfound Republic and the
Empire) and set up the semi-autonomous Ammatar Mandate. The Mandate has
its own nominal

Amarrian governor (currently the Heir [Yonis
Ardishapur](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Yonis_Ardishapur)) and its
fleet is under the control of the Empire, but they also have several
direct links to Jamyl's Imperial Court to ensure Ammatar concerns are
heard.

As noted, the Ammatar's hiding of the Starkmanir came to light only in
the past few years. During the [Elder
Fleet](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Elder_Fleet) Invasion [of YC
110](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Year_YC110#The_Minmatar_Fleet),
the Elders made a stop in the Mandate to pick up most of the Starkman
survivors as well as any Nefantar who wanted to return to the Republic.
Even the head of the Mandate encouraged the Ammatar to return. Today,
the Mandate still stands in a bit of a state of shock as it tries to
regain its footing. After the previous Mandate governor resigned to
return to the Republic, Empress Jamyl placed the Mandate under the
stewardship of Heir Yonis Ardishapur. Although many Nefantar decided to
return, the Mandate itself survives and many have chosen to remain under
Empire protection.

Angel Cartel
------------

One of the more established of the pirate factions, the [Angel
Cartel's](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Angel_Cartel) main base of
operations is in the
[Curse](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Curse_(lore)) region,
though they seem to have tendrils just about everywhere. Little is known
about their history or structure, other than that there are four main
divisions of the Cartel: the
[Dominations](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dominations) (the
command branch of the Cartel), the
[Archangels](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Archangels_(NPC_corporation))
(the main combat arm of the Cartel), the [Guardian
Angels](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Guardian_Angels_(NPC_corporation))
(whose sole purpose appears to be guarding
[Serpentis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Serpentis) assets), and
the [Salvation
Angels](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Salvation_Angels_(NPC_corporation))
(maintenance and repair division). The leading theory is that the Cartel
originally formed from a loose group of pirate groups, but frankly
that's a boring theory and I would prefer to think that pirate space
kittens have something to do with it.

The Cartel has extensive holdings throughout the Empires, but mainly
focus on the Minmatar regions, where they gain most of their recruits.
Many Matari that join are disaffected by the Republic, but recent
changes (most notably the recovery of the Starkmanir and the Elder Fleet
invasion) have noticeably slowed recruitment efforts. Still, this hasn't
yet seemed to harm Angel holdings, which include significant control
over the Caldari "grey market" (bringing in illegal, competing products
to the megacorporation's own enclaves). They've also been known to work
with the Sisters of EVE (described below) in humanitarian missions (per
*The Burning Life*). There are even some rumors saying that they've
managed to acquire examples of Jove technology to integrate into their
ships, but for obvious reasons the Dominations haven't chosen to divulge
that information. Given the fact that
[Curse](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Curse_(Region)) is the
home of the First and Second Jovian Empire, however, such rumors may not
be all that far off-base.

Blood Raider Covenant
---------------------

It might surprise you to know that there is an even darker side to an
already dark religion that allows and even encourages slavery of
sentient beings. An offshoot of the mainstream Amarr religion [dating
back](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Pre-Space_Flight_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Sani_Sabik_Outbreak)
to the pre-space-flight days, the [Sani
Sabik](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sani_Sabik) (some call it a
religion of its own, others call it a cult) agree with the main religion
that some people are born great, while others must serve those born to
greatness. Where the Sani Sabik differ, however, is the use of blood in
many of their rituals in order to obtain either physical or spiritual
immortality. Rituals vary from sect to sect, but the more "mainstream"
portions of the religion tend to use
[blood](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Blooding) donated willingly by
its own members. Other portions believe that only blood taken from the
[unclean and
unperfected](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Half_a_Life_(Chronicle))
will do. The Sani Sabik have been exiled a number of times from Amarr
space (one such exile [apparently leading to the creation of the
Takmahl](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Sani_Sabik_Uprising),
so think about THAT next time you're in Araz), but like any good pest,
the Empire seems incapable of eradicating them completely.

The more militaristic of this subset of a subset of a minority join the
[Blood
Raider](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Blood_Raiders_(Chronicle))
[Covenant](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Blood_Raiders), though I'll
note that Source uses Sani Sabik and the Raiders fairly interchangeably
(and dives into other considerations quite a bit more). These raiders
ply the spacelanes, mostly focused on getting the blood of capsuleers
(though they will not turn down a passing unarmed ship) for their
rituals. This, oddly, is actually a step up, as before the advent of
capsuleers, the Raiders focused primarily on children as

their targets. The Covenant, and the Sani Sabik in general, have long
had friends in the upper levels of the Amarr imperial court. Most
recently, the former [Court
Chamberlain](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Court_Chamberlain)
[Dochuta Karsoth](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dochuta_Karsoth)
scandalized Amarr Prime when, after the Elder Fleet invaded, he ran to
the Covenant for protection. A long history of collusion was discovered,
and Karsoth was eventually captured and executed on Empress Jamyl's
order. Since then, the Covenant has been set back on its heels a bit,
but the Covenant and the Sani Sabik sect continue to have small, but
significant support throughout the Empire. It probably shouldn't
surprise anyone that the Covenant excels at the bio-sciences and human
anatomy. There are also some suggestions that the Covenant excels at
selective breeding and other metabolic manipulation, leading to very
robust and physically fit soldiers.

The Covenant is currently run by the person responsible for its recent
rise in power and sophistication: [Omir
Sarikusa](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Omir_Sarikusa). Around him
are a close inner circle of theological and legal advisors, mostly given
the ominous title of "Bleeders."

Equilibrium of Mankind
----------------------

A minor player in a host of minor players, the [Equilibrium of
Mankind](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Equilibrium_of_Mankind)
nonetheless has a notable role playing contingent, as well as a
surprisingly well-developed backstory. The order, like the Blood Raider
Covenant, is a split off sect of the Amarr religion. The sect was
started by Ocilan Ardishapur, the brother to the [Ardishapur
Heir](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ardishapur_Family_(NPC_corporation))
at the time. Ocilan's sect split off about [2,000 years
ago](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Unchallenged_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Equilibrium_of_Mankind.5B3.5D),
however, when ancient texts were discovered. These texts had a profound
effect on Ocilan. The texts spoke of the downfall and doom of humanity
should it decide to remain where God has forbidden it (meaning New Eden,
of course). Only those who help to reconstruct the "pathway to Heaven"
can be saved from God's wrath, as this was the only path to salvation.
The texts were quickly declared apocryphal by the main Amarr church (the
irony, of course, being that this probably refers to the destruction
that befell New Eden after the collapse of EVE Gate and an attempt to
rally people to reconstruct the gateway home), but Ocilan (a wealthy and
charismatic fellow) managed to gather a substantial following, calling
itself the Equilibrium of Mankind. The main Church, worried at his surge
of popularity and uncomfortable with his message, exiled him from
Ardishapur Prime. They established a new colony, and Ocilan, originally
thought assassinated, declared war against all who didn't join him in
Equilibrium. Since then, the EoM continue their war against the rest of
the cluster in obscurity, though they apparently have been making a
comeback in recent years.

Guristas
--------

The [Guristas Pirates](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Guristas) are
perhaps the one pirate group that like to yarr for the sake of yarring.
Founded by [Jirai
Laitanen](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jirai_Laitanen) and [Korako
Kosakami](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Korako_Kosakami) in YC 86,
the Guristas have a bit of a colorful backstory. The two met each other
while members of the 37th Squadron (apparently, the Octopuses) of the
Caldari Navy. Within the span of a week, Laitanen was passed over for a
promotion (despite having an apparently promising career) and Kosakami
was blamed for a fatal crash landing. These "injustices" (ok, maybe
Kosakami had a valid complaint) were the catalyst needed for the two
friends to steal a pair of Condor-class frigates and desert the Navy,
heading off to the lawless lands between the Caldari and the Gallente.
They quickly set up their own pirate organization, and have been
spreading terror under their nicknames: [Fatal and the
Rabbit](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Fatal_and_the_Rabbit_(Chronicle)).

These days, the Guristas are known for being one of the few pirate
organizations willing to hit colonies in civilized (high security)
space. They are also known [for creating civilian mining
colonies](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/All_These_Lives_are_Fit_to_Ruin_(Chronicle))
and protecting them with their own security forces. Like the Angels,
they have a sizeable share of the Caldari grey market under their
control, and also run an illegal currency exchange. The Guristas also
played a major part in the collapse of the [Crielere
Project](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Crielere), a joint
Caldari-Gallente research initiative that, among other things, produced
the basics for cloaking technology. Tensions between the State and the
Federation rose to such a degree that, after it was revealed the Caldari
had pilfered some of the blueprints, both sides quickly withdrew
protection and funds from the Project. From there, the Guristas swooped
in, raiding the station not once, but twice, eventually making off with
the two top researchers, who eventually perished.

Intaki Syndicate
----------------

The [Intaki
Syndicate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki_Syndicate) runs the
largest black market in New Eden.
[Headed](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Silphy_(Chronicle)) by
[Silphy en Diabel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Silphy_en_Diabel)
(a former member of the Sisters of EVE who quickly rose through the
ranks through some cunning and ruthless strategies), the Syndicate was
originally formed by Intaki exiles from the first Gallente-Caldari war
who, like the Caldari, wanted to secede from the Federation (a strain of
thought that continues to this day in some portions of the Intaki
populace). Today, the Syndicate takes care of much of the peacekeeping
in and around Intaki space since they happen to run quite the crime, ah,
syndicate, if you didn't get that from the name. They also excel at
establishing [market](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki_Commerce)
and [banking](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki_Bank) services
for anyone who can't get what they need legally. The Syndicate also
serves as a back channel for diplomatic relations between the major
empires, which is why the Federation hasn't seen fit to close it down
despite its notoriety.

Intaki Culture
--------------

This seems as good a time as any to do a brief sidenote on
[Intaki](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki) history and religion.
The Intaki were originally discovered by the Gallente in 22794 AD, about
330 years prior to the founding of the Federation. A primitive culture
at the time, they quickly caught up to the Gallente technologically, and
were one of the Federation's founding members. However, relations with
the Federation have not always been smooth. As noted above, a sizeable
fraction of the populace sympathized with the Caldari when they seceded,
and the Federation did not hesitate to exile those who showed such
sympathies.

Two later events did not help Federal relations with the Intaki. First,
in [YC 108](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki#Reschard_V), there
was a [massive
explosion](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Year_YC108#February) on one
of the Intaki's main agricultural colonies on Reschard V. Despite being
Federation territory, the Federation barely responded, leaving it to the
Sisters of EVE and Mordu's Legion (both discussed below) to coordinate
rescue efforts that took almost [seven
months](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Year_YC108#September) to
complete. Investigations showed that the explosion was probably caused
by a [titan](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Titan) detonating a
doomsday device in low orbit, although neither the Sisters nor Mordu
were able to discover who caused it. Some suggest CONCORD has the
answer, but they have refused to release it.

Another event that hurt Intaki-Federal relations was the start of the
Empyrean War. Intaki had long been considered low-security space (though
[they originally
asked](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki#History_and_Politics)
for minimal protections, they have come to resent the minimal defense in
recent years), and the Federation has never committed significant assets
to its protection. This showed when, a few months after the new wars
started up with the help of capsuleer militias, [Intaki
fell](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki#The_Empyrean_Age_-_YC_110_to_present)
to a concerted Caldari offensive. The system was eventually auctioned
off by Caldari authorities to Ishukone. The literature suggests that
there were some backroom deals between Ishukone and unknown third
parties to set up a protection scheme for Intaki itself (though that is
generally not very well known by the public). Still, Intaki in the
Federation took the system's fall hard and this has only enlivened the
secessionist debate.

One of the more unique aspects of Intaki culture is that of its
religion,
[Ida](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Intaki#Ida_-_The_Intaki_Faith),
meaning "to consider". The Intaki see life as just a continuous cycle.
Life leads to death leads to life. Followers of Ida strive for
moderation in all things, as that is the best way to continue the cycle
uninterrupted. Interestingly, they also believe in the rebirth of souls.
Through the use of rituals and technology, the Intaki have found a way
to ensure that souls from some dying individuals are able to be
transferred to newborn babies. These so-called Reborn are given a place
of respect among the Intaki, though the title of Idama is only reserved
for those who are Reborn without the use of technology.

InterBus
--------

A joint project between the four empires,
[InterBus](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_InterBus_(Chronicle))
was created to ensure some mode of personnel and cargo transportation
throughout the Cluster. Despite being a governmental creature, it has
striven to remain above the partisan fray and stay neutral to all
parties (major empires or pirate gangs) to ensure that their shuttles
can make it through to any system or station. While InterBus has highly
accurate maps and data, they are a [closely guarded
secret](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/InterBus) to anyone outside
the organization. They also recently participated in the [buyout of all
CONCORD owned customs
offices](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Welcome_Party_(Chronicle)),
although that may not have been the best deal for them. On a more
interesting sidenote, it seems that CCP originally intended InterBus to
allow limited cargo ferrying between systems for a fee. Clearly, that
feature never quite made it to the game, but it's something that is
brought up now and then anyway.

Khanid Kingdom
--------------

Another pseudo-Amarr protectorate, the [Khanid
Kingdom](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid_Kingdom) came into
existence about 300 years ago. As you may recall from the discussion on
the Amarr, the losing Heirs are all required to commit [succession
trials](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Shathol%27Syn) ritualistic
suicide after the(http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarr\_Succession).
I mentioned at the time that there were 5 royal families: the Sarums,
the Kadors, the Kor-Azors, the Ardishapurs and the Tash-Murkons.
However, prior to 23041 AD, the Khanids were actually the fifth Royal
Family. In that year, the succession trials were underway, eventually
being won by [Emperor Heideran
VII](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Heideran_VII). This meant that
the other heirs, including one Garkeh Khanid, were expected to commit
suicide. Garkeh was a young Heir, however, and had only recently
ascended to Heir status. He apparently was rather loath to give up the
status, so instead of following ritual, he decided to secede from the
Empire rather than kill himself, crowning himself [Khanid
II](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid_II). He was briefly opposed
by his brother, [Dakos](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Dakos_Khanid),
who wanted to return to the Empire, but Dakos was assassinated before he
could mount serious resistance. This left a bit of a bitter taste in
Garkeh's mouth, however, and he apparently remains a [tad
paranoid](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid_Kingdom#Secession)
regarding his family and whether they are plotting to overthrow him.
Khanid remains a separate sovereignty to this day (and the
[Tash-Murkons](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Tash-Murkon_Family)
were elevated to the status of an Heir family), even taking an inversion
of the [Amarr
seal](http://community.eveonline.com/backstory/chronicles/signs-of-faith/)
to show their independence.

For being separate, however, the Khanid Kingdom today takes many affects
from the Empire. Khanid II maintained the general structure of the
Empire, including Holders and slaves. Indeed, since the whole "we don't
want to be part of your empire anymore"

business, they've actually cultivated fairly close relations with both
the Empire and the Caldari State, to the point that Khanid even [has a
seat](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Khanid_II#Rule_over_the_Khanid_Kingdom)
on the Empress's [Privy
Council](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Privy_Council). The Khanid
are seen as a little more progressive, however, since they need to rely
on outside trade and new technological development to survive much more
so than their Amarr counterparts.

Mordu's Legion
--------------

As with most primarily Caldari organizations, the roots of [Mordu's
Legion](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mordu%27s_Legion) can be
traced back to the Gallente-Caldari War. As I have discussed already,
there was a sizeable fraction of Intaki who [sympathized with the
Caldari](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mordu%27s_Legion_(Chronicle)),
to the point where they wanted to defect to the State. Many of these
defectors had significant military experience. In response, the
fledgling State military command put all the veterans in one squadron,
under the command of [Muryia
Mordu](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Muryia_Mordu). They quickly
became one of the most successful units in the war. Afterwards, many of
the Intaki settled in the Caldari system of Kamokor. However, radicals
and xenophobes soon took control of the colony and drove the Intaki out.
In desperation, they called Muryia for help, who was happy to oblige.
They quickly retook the colony, and from there, Muryia decided to
constitute the Legion. Today, the Legion stands as the premier mercenary
squadron in New Eden (take THAT, Pandemic Legion). Indeed, the Legion is
so well-regarded that they were called upon by Ishukone and the Gallente
senate to act as a [neutral police force on Caldari
Prime](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Mordu%27s_Legion#Caldari_Prime_Peacekeeping).

The Legion has cultivated close ties with the State, despite not being
controlled by them. As such, the State often gives Mordu access to
cutting edge technology. However, Mordu (as seen in *Templar One*) is
willing to assist anyone, and he alone decides which contracts the
Legion will take up. He's a bit of an oddball, and is well-known for his
odd sense of fashion, but he's still very much revered by the Intaki
veterans and others who have joined the Legion since. The Legion
provides no training, and expects those who want to join to be
well-versed in combat already.

Outer Ring Excavations (ORE)
----------------------------

Miner RPers out there can rejoice: even YOU can RP thanks to [Outer Ring
Excavations](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Outer_Ring_Excavations)!
The biggest mining consortium in New Eden, ORE (see what they did
there?) was founded back in YC 91 when its founder, [Yani Sar
Arteu](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Yani_Sar_Arteu), broke away
from the Gallente mining consortium Astral Mining. Arteu decided to
strike off into the outer regions of New Eden, making his home in [Outer
Ring](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Outer_Ring) and Cloud Ring.
Until then, those regions had only been considered of moderate value,
and not particularly worth the risk of mining out there. However, that
was before the discovery [of
noxcium](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Nocxium_(lore)), a rare
ore that forms only during a supernova. The ore is vital for, among
other things, building capsules. Once the importance of the ore was
discovered, ORE became a massive and wealthy company almost overnight.
Rumor has it that they had discovered a smal moon worth of the stuff,
giving them a massive market share in the new mineral. Although the
various empires (notably the Gallente) tried to demand the location of
the large deposit, ORE kept the location secret and built its market
share. Today, ORE is well known for developing top-of-the-line mining
ships and equipment. It was originally close to Mordu's Legion, but that
changed when Serpentis (discussed below) bought a majority share in ORE.

Rogue Drones
------------

[Rogue drones](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Rogue_Drones) are a bit
unique. They're not quite a faction, but they're significant enough to
warrant their discussion here (not to mention being the focus [of
significant research
projects](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan:_Rogue_Drones).

As might be expected given their reliance on drone technology, [rogue
drones](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Rogue_Drones_(Chronicle))
had their start in Gallente military research. There was a continued
drive to put more and more weapons on bigger and bigger drones that were
getting smarter and smarter all the time (you can probably see where
this is going). Some of these drones were even equipped with warp
drives: they were ships with everything except a human in command. Well,
the inevitable happened (as it tends to do), and the drones at some
point gained sentience and realized that they didn't particularly enjoy
being bossed around by ugly bags of mostly water. They soon went on a
rampage, escaping from their labs. The incident prompted CONCORD to
issue directive
[Omega-One-Five](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Concord_directive_omega-one-five),
banning all research into creating self-aware artificial intelligences.

The now-escaped drones began to act as many living things do: making
their homes in space, mining for minerals, and attacking other living
things (read: ships) in order to appropriate their resources. The drones
next popped up when the Gallente discovered a few new regions. During
[Operation Spectrum
Breach](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Spectrum_Breach), they began
colonizing the new systems in YC 88. About 4 months into the process,
however, the drones under Gallente command went berserk, killing
hundreds. This happened simultaneously across dozens of systems. The
Gallente quickly locked down the regions (now known, appropriately, as
the [Drone Regions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Drone_Regions)).
When CONCORD discovered the new colonies and what happened, they
immediately took jurisdiction over the gates and continued the lockdown.
They initiated a review of Gallente actions in the [Code Aria
Inquiry](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Code_Aria_Inquiry),
documenting what the investigation found in their
[report](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Talk:Code_Aria_Inquiry). The
report suggested that the Gallente and CreoDron had violated
Omega-One-Five under a project codenamed
[Orphyx](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Orphyx_Program) and
created more self-aware drones in the process. The report was kept
top-secret, and apparently not even released to the four empires. The
Gallente were highly embarrassed about this, of course, and halted their
expansion programs.

The Drone Regions were cut off from the rest of New Eden for the next 20
years, and CONCORD seemed to have every intention of keeping them locked
down. The situation changed dramatically however in [YC
108](http://community.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1329&tid=4)
when the gates to the Drone Regions re-enabled themselves. CONCORD was
unable to lock the gates down again. Around this time, the Code Aria
report was leaked to the public, prompting outcries from both the
[public and
governments](http://community.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=1814&tid=4)
alike. However, the damage was done and the Drone Regions remain open to
this day.

Sansha's Nation
---------------

Zombies have long been a part of popular culture (and apparently growing
in popularity in recent years, vampire craze notwithstanding), so it
only makes sense that a cyberpunk version of zombies made their
appearance in EVE. They make their appearance through the pirates known
as [Sansha's
Nation](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sansha%27s_Nation). Founded by
[Sansha Kuvakei](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sansha_Kuvakei), the
Nation originally started as a way for Kuvakei to fulfill his utopian
ideals. He and his Caldari family had grown rich through arms
manufacturing during the Gallente-Caldari war, and he struck out in YC 4
to settle what would eventually be called the Stain region. Out there,
he set out to build his empire, preaching his utopian ideals. His nation
and his beliefs earned great praise throughout the Cluster and he soon
found himself on the front edge of galactic politics. Unfortunately,
Kuvakei had a bit of a megalomaniacal streak to him, and all the praise
went to his head. He began to seriously believe himself as a kind of
deity (or perhaps he was always crazy), and believed that others should
serve him. If they did not want to willingly serve him, he would make
them serve him. He began experimenting with the recently-gifted
capsuleer implant technology to create so-called [True
Slaves](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/True_Slaves): people who have
lost their own free will and are under the direct control of Kuvakei
(the Amarr, in [their infinite
kindness](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Beginnings_2),
gave Kuvakei a number of Matari slaves to experiment on in hopes of
gaining better slave control technology). A "lucky" few are allowed to
retain some degree of free wil: these are known as True Citizens, and
often serve in leadership roles. Kuvakei's command and control scheme is
quite extensive, utilizing direct linkups from each drone into a kind of
hive mind (if he starts calling himself the Borg Queen, I'm leaving
again). Despite these experiments, the empires either truly didn't know
the extent of his experiments or chose to ignore the obvious
[slavery](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Slavery#Sansha.27s_Nation)
implications.

However, the full extent of his experiments came to light in [YC
34](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sansha%27s_Nation_(Chronicle)).
Despite the monstrous experiments, they did have one positive result: it
led to the creation of the first (and, to my knowledge, only) offensive
that was coordinated among all four of the major empires, lead by the
Gallente. They swept through Stain, wiping out all known colonies and
presumably killing Kuvakei himself. The remaining small cadre of Nation
officers was left to drift for several decades. They eventually managed
to re-organize, and [reappeared in the galactic
scene](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sansha%27s_Nation#Reemergence)
in YC 105, attacking the Amarr Empire and the Angel Cartel for a while.
However, they seemed to be of no particularly major threat to anyone,
and despite some talk of a major offensive to wipe them out again,
nothing happened, and the Nation soon drifted into obscurity again.

Unexpectedly, the Nation [returned with a
vengeance](https://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sansha#Revival) in YC 112.
After almost 4 years of near silence, the Nation suddenly began invading
the heart of empire space, raiding planets and [abducting
millions](http://community.eveonline.com/news/news-channels/world-news/multiple-sansha-attacks-reported-low-security-population-left-devastated/)
from the surface, presumably for transformation into True Slaves. Sansha
Kuvakei has also apparently re-emerged, although not everyone is
convinced that this is actually Kuvakei instead of a replacement of some
kind. Capsuleers soon came to the rescue when it became clear that
Empire navies and CONCORD were unable to deal with the coordinated,
lightning swift assaults that soon became the Nation's hal mark (these
attacks, not to be confused with incursions, are known as live events.
Generally lead by one Sansha member played by a CCP employee, he'll
bring hundreds of ships into one system and players are expected to
respond and defend the colonies. These live events (of which there are
other kinds, but this has been the main kind in recent years) can be
very entertaining, and a great way to dip your toe into RPing if you're
looking for a way to get started, though they tend to be somewhat few
and far between these days). Things grew more ominous when it was
discovered that the Nation had discovered how to create their own
wormholes to invade any system they chose, and even MORE ominous when
pictures suggested that the Nation had conquered at least [one Jove
system](http://community.eveonline.com/news.asp?a=single&nid=3967&tid=4)
to serve as a base of operations. The only response from the Jove was a
terse message explaining that they had retaken the station in question.
That message has been the last that anyone has heard from the Jove.

These days, the Nation has for the most part abandoned its single-system
strategy after a climactic battle in Yulai near the end of YC 113. The
Nation now favors constellation-wide
[incursions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Incursion), where they
attempt to disrupt life as much as humanly possible.

Kuvakei's rhetoric has also been tweaked in recent days. Although he
continues to speak of
[unity](http://community.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1454703&page=1#1),
he has also taken special interest in capsuleers, trying to
[rally](http://community.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1318980&page=4#108)
them specifically to [his
cause](http://community.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1318980&page=4#108).
What the future holds for Sansha and his Nation at this point are
anything but clear, and the Empires have shown no particular desire to
repeat the sweep of YC 37.

Serpentis
---------

The major drug runners in Eve,
[Serpentis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Serpentis), was originally
created as a legitimate biochemical company in the Federation. Founded
by [Igil Sarpati](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Igil_Sarpati) back
when [neural
boosters](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Neural_boosters) were legal
throughout New Eden, the company quickly degenerated to the darker side
of biochemistry by investing heavily in the drug and booster trade after
boosters were outlawed (for SOME reason the empires thought dying a
terrible and painful death was a *bad* thing).

Today, the company is a broad-based high-tech R&D company with a core
competency in biochemistry (that's a fancy and corporate-speak way of
saying that they make drugs). The current CEO, [Salvador
Sarpati](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Salvador_Sarpati), Igil's
adopted son, moved the corporation out to the Fountain region, and even
bought himself his own system: [Serpentis
Prime](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Serpentis_Prime_(System)).
The
[Sarpatis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Sarpati_Family_(Chronicle))
continue to run Serpentis out in the depths of null security space: the
only exception is Salvador's sister
[Santimona](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Santimona_Sarpati), who is
currently head of the Sisters of Eve. Serpentis continues to research
and produce boosters and other illicit drugs for capsuleers and the
public alike, though they do their best to cloak their actions in
running a legitimate corporation. As mentioned above, the Serpentis have
cultivated a close relationship with the Angel Cartel, particularly
their [Guardian
Angels](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Guardian_Angels), who guard
their research assets.

Sisters of Eve
--------------

CCP prides itself on showing humanity's darker side in EVE Online. But
even in EVE, there has to be SOME force for good. That force mostly
manifests itself in the Servant [Sisters of
Eve](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sisters_of_EVE), a humanitarian
aid organization universally recognized for its neutrality and
dedication to helping any and all who need it (think of it as the Red
Cross of the EVE universe). Originating in the depths of the
Caldari-Gallente War, the Sisterhood prides itself as the leading
humanitarian aid organization in the Cluster. Since its formation, it
led relief missions during the Minmatar Rebellion as well as the brief
Amarr-Jove War. Today, it has established a number of sanctuaries for
weary travelers or those seeking safety, most of them just outside of
empire space, though some refugee camps are established within empire
space [as
necessary](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/11/20/sister-camp/). The
organization is headed by the Reverend Mother, currently [Santimona
Sarpati](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Santimona_Sarpati), the
sister to the head of the Serpentis Corporation, though the two
organizations (and siblings, for that matter) are in no way close.
Beyond the Sisterhood itself, it also runs a food relief program known
simply as [Food Relief](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Food_Relief).

Beyond its humanitarian mission, however, the Sisterhood is also a
religious order. Another division of the Sisterhood, known as [the
Sanctuary](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Sanctuary_(Chronicle)),
[focuses its work](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Sanctuary) on
the study of what it calls a ['relic from
God'](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Sisters_of_EVE_(Collective)):
the [EVE Gate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/EVE_Gate). Headed by
the High Priestess [Harna
Durado](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Harna_Durado), the Sanctuary
is the premier research institution that studies the Gate. What, if
anything, they've found in the Gate has remained a mystery to the
general public, but they are known to keep a ship stationed as close the
Gate as it can get without being ripped apart by the [intense
turbulence](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Where_Do_We_Come_From.3F)
(the Gate, alas, is located approximately 3 lightyears outside of the
New Eden system, and is inaccessible to us capsuleers). High Priestess
Durado has decreed that research continue, however, since they believe
that the Gate is key to getting access to heaven.

There have been some indications of an ulterior agenda for the Sisters,
however. Although publicly the Sisterhood has distanced itself from the
current unofficial head of the Intaki Syndicate, [Silphy en
Diabel](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Silphy_en_Diabel), there are
[some
indications](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ante_(Chronicle))
that the Sisters and the Syndicate have worked together to use unwitting
capsuleers as part of its research projects. A few years back, all
capsuleers received a limited edition shuttle known as the
[Zephyr](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Zephyr), designed by the
Intaki polymath [Valsas en
Dilat](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Valsas_en_Dilat). For unknown
reasons, there does appear to be some indication of collusion with the
Syndicate to use the Zephyrs, which are apparently invisible to Sleepers
(meaning that they can fly around any Sleeper site in w-space without
getting attacked by the drones... players of course are another matter)
to col ect data for the Sisters. Obviously, this isn't known to the
general populace (indeed, only Silphy and Santimona appear to know
anything about it), so it should be considered off-limits to characters,
but it's an interesting subplot nonetheless.

Society of Conscious Thought
----------------------------

As with anything Jove-related, the [Society of Conscious
Thought](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Society_of_Conscious_Thought_(Chronicle))
is best described as a mystery wrapped in an
[enigma](http://eve.wikia.com/wiki/Enigma) wrapped in a
person-with-a-genetic-deformity-that-will-lead-to-death-by-depression.
Founded about 300 years ago now [by Ior
Labron](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Ior_Labron), the Society was
originally founded as a spiritual institution and an attempt to discern
the meaning of life, based partly on [the
teachings](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Truth_Serum_(Chronicle))
of Ior's mentor, [Gorda
Hoje](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Gorda_Hoje). Though the Jove are
not generally a spiritual people, those that do look towards faith look
with zest. Although it had its start as a religious institution, the
Society soon took on a political dimension, gaining quite a bit of clout
within the [Jovian
Directorate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jovian_directorate_(NPC_corporation))
and in many respects acting like a shadow government. Eventually, the
clout became too much, and the Society was kicked out of the politics
business. Thoroughly chastised, the Society withdrew from political
life, and various splinter groups of the Society settled in remote
regions. These settlements, named
[kitzes](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Kitz), were self-sustaining
enclaves where research continued apace. They also established schools
that quickly became well-respected throughout the Cluster.

The Society is not without its [darker
side](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hyperconsciousness_(Chronicle)),
however. It came to light a few decades ago that some kitzes were
apparently working with Sansha Kuvakei to help develop his [True
Slaves](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/True_Slaves). This again
rocked the Society back on its heels, and in an attempt to repair
relations with the Cluster, the Society opened its renowned schools up
to all races. It also set its sight on a new, seemingly more benign area
of research: the social sciences. The Society soon realized through its
research that it was possible to individually tailor educational
programs to a specific child based on that child's tendencies, and that
these programs could even help curb detrimental tendencies in a child.
This in and of itself was nothing new in education, but as usual, the
Jove took things a bit too far when it combined these new programs with
its research on mood enhancers. What many people would call a form of
brainwashing, the Society called its
[Hyperconsciousness](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Hyperconsciousness_(Chronicle))
agenda, and it's been used on the children admitted to its schools for
quite a while now (the extent of the program is not known publicly).

More recently, the Society has focused its efforts on technology that
helps its social sciences studies, including an amnesiac agent. Much of
its effort in recent years, however, has been focused around the Book of
Emptiness. The Book, in reality a small machine named after a lost Amarr
[holy](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Book_of_Emptiness_(Part_1)_(Chronicle))
[book](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Book_of_Emptiness_(Part_2)_(Chronicle)),
was an attempt to cure the [Jovian
Disease](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jovian_Disease) by removing
all negative thoughts and emotions. Unfortunately, it had the unintended
side effect of reducing its users to slobbering idiots. Needless to say,
it was rejected as a cure for the Disease, but the Society has focused
its research efforts on it in recent years regardless, even if its
agenda is not known publicly. Indeed, publicly, the Society and its
kitzes are still held in very high regard as the premier educational
institutions in New Eden.

Technology
==========

For a game that takes place 21,000 years in the future, technology
actually plays a fairly secondary role in the lore. That is a testament
to CCP's content writers who avoid, as much as possible, the whole
"technobabble saves us all" approach to conflict resolution (much as it
pains me to say this, my beloved Star Trek is particularly bad at this).
Still, it'd be ridiculous if CCP didn't lay down SOME background
knowledge on the technology that makes our lives in space possible. I'm
only going to be covering the big ones here, but there's [a LOT of
lore](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Technology_of_New_Eden) out
there for anyone who's interested in the more mechanical side of things.

Capsules
--------

Ah, the capsule. The pod. The egg. As particularly bad trolls try to say
in help chat now and then (feel free to say hi to me in there if you see
me), some think it's a sign that you've leveled up when it first
appears. The
[capsule](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Capsule_(lore)) is the
singular achievement that separates us players of EVE Online from the
general unkempt masses. The deep history of the capsule is, to my
knowledge, completely unknown to us, in game or out. What we do know is
that the Jove (for reasons unknown) [offered
Ishukone](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Jovian_Wetgrave) capsule
technology in 23224 AD, shortly before the battle at Iyen-Oursta. In
exchange, Ishukone handed over significant amounts of cultural and
social information.

The capsule offers a pilot complete and unfettered access to a ship
using only one's mind, while cocooning the body in a hydrostatic fluid
containing oxygen and nutrients that dampens undue stresses (and means
that we breathe and eat liquid which is just WEIRD). Connections are
made directly to the pilot's nervous system that allows them to feel
each time a ship gets hit, to move the ship as one would move a muscle,
and to see out of a ship's [camera
drones](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Camera_Drones_(Chronicle))
as if it were their own eyes. The ship's computer even creates sounds to
feed into a pilot's auditory cortex to help the pilot situate himself in
space. This direct connection to the ship drastically lowers a ship's
[crew
requirements](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/New_Eden_crew_guidelines),
hile also dramatically decreasing reaction times. The end result is a
faster, leaner ship that has even more capabilities than a ship with a
crew twice its size. This, incidentally, is the theoretical reason why
we players are able to kill rats as easily as we do. Capsule-piloted
ships are so efficient that they take on ships the same size or even
larger vessels with nary a scratch. Obviously, when a pod-piloted vessel
explodes, one of its last orders of business is to safely eject the pod
from the dying ship (the rest of the crew may or may not be as lucky).

But the capsule is not without its risks. Beyond the risk that a
potential pilot doesn't have the proper [genetic
makeup](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Capsule_and_the_Clone#A_Match_Made_in_Heaven),
the biggest risk to the average would-be capsuleer (ignoring the
apparently painful process of adapting your body to the capsule; you
know, holes in your spine, parts of your skull peeled away to make way
for implants, etc...) is something known as
"[mindlock](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Jovian_Wetgrave)". It
apparently occurs when the brain isn't able to "shrink" itself back down
to a mere human body. It got accustomed to controlling the pod and/or
ship, and once unplugged, it couldn't re-engage its connection to the
much more frail human body. In the chronicle I linked here, it's quite
clear that a mindlocked pilot is still fully conscious and aware of
what's going on around him, just unable to move. However, even the Jove
apparently didn't know at that time whether a person was still conscious
in a mindlocked pilot. It's still not clear where the state of research
is on mindlock in modern times. What IS clear, however, is that the
incident rate of mindlock is very low today, thanks to better training
techniques, so it's not a big deal these days.

Even if you meet the minimal requirements, however, becoming a pod pilot
is a time consuming endeavor. Potential candidates have to be in perfect
physical condition and basically a genius (fun fact: you need an
advanced degree to become a capsuleer, so congratulations on all you new
Space Doctors out there!). After that begins a five year physical and
technical training program, which includes such fun activities as 10
days of sensory deprivation, shock simulations, and other grueling
physical tests to accustom your mind to the concept of thinking of the
ship as its body. The last step in the training program is submitting to
voluntary euthanasia to clone yourself to your new body (so sorry to all
of those high sec people who say they've never been podded before).

Cloning
-------

While the capsule alone dramatically increases a ship's effectiveness,
the thing that truly makes us pod pilots truly immortal is the joining
of a capsule with cloning technology. Cloning has been around in New
Eden for a while (a business prospectus of one cloning company, Cromeaux
Inc., can be found [here](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Cloning),
which describes the basic process). But this isn't modern real life
cloning, where your DNA is taken and a clone is grown like a child would
be. Rather, biomass of some kind (usually, human cadavers in the high
quality clones (yes, [it's made of
people](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Vicious_Cycle_(Chronicle))),
but apparently any kind of biomass will do) is used to create a human
body with functioning organs. These generic humans are then seeded with
a customer's DNA and stem cel s, so within a few months the body is made
up mostly of a customer's own actual DNA. Tattoos, skin coloration, and
piercings can be applied as the process continues. The one organ missing
is the brain.

The brain is instead grown individually after a cloning contract is
created. When a person becomes a clone company's customer, a brain scan
is taken to get the brain's shape and major nerve clusters positioned
appropriately. This scan is used to create a gel model that eventually
leads to neuronal growth that matches the customer's own brain
structures. This new brain is seeded with receptors attached to an FTL
communication receiver (we'll talk briefly about that in a bit). If
that's a bit too technobabble-y for you, the process is essentially that
a person's personal brain is created from the scan, it just doesn't have
any power to it yet.

At the moment of a customer's death, a snapshot of the brain is taken
using a [transneural burning
scanner](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transneural_burning_scanner).
This scanner is able to see, down to individual neurons, the exact state
of a person's mind at the time of death. The scanning process has the
somewhat unfortunate side-effect of completely destroying the original
brain (and if that's not sufficient, a quick-acting neurotoxin is
injected just to be sure), but it is able to then transmit the brain's
state via FTL communications to the new clone. In the new brain, the
transmitted patterns can quickly be almost precisely duplicated using
the aforementioned receivers. The "almost" is key: the quality of the
scan and how well it's copied to the new clone at the moment of death
can vary. As you learn more, you need a higher quality of clone to make
sure the more complex information is transferred properly to the new
clone, which is why you need to upgrade your clones now and then to hold
more skills. The whole process of transferring consciousness can be
completed within moments.

Unfortunately, modern burning scanners are somewhat large contraptions
that require a person's head to be in precise alignment at the moment of
death. Because planning death this precisely can be difficult, cloning
and transfer never quite gained wide

traction throughout the cluster, remaining the province of the rich for
the most part. This changed, however, [when engineers
realized](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Capsule_and_the_Clone#A_Match_Made_in_Heaven)
that there was a significant and growing population who would always be
in the same position when they were most likely to die: pod pilots. The
two technologies were successfully combined in YC 104, with the neural
scanner now tied directly to a pod's structural integrity system. When
the pod detects a breach of any kind (since the chances of surviving a
pod breach are minimal anyway), the scanner is automatically activated
and that body is instantly kil ed, with the consciousness of that person
transferred to the new clone body (Soul? We don't need to know what a
stinkin' soul is). CONCORD quickly authorized (and, indeed, required)
the use of cloning technology in pod pilots in YC 105 (conveniently, the
game year that EVE Online starts in). The age of the pod pilot had
begun.

DUST 514 Technology
-------------------

DUST 514 will be adding some new technology that, while it technically
won't have much of an effect in our game, will certainly affect the game
universe. The most important of the new tech involves the mercenary
implants, which takes the aforementioned cloning technology to a new
extreme. I mentioned above that normal cloning scanners require the head
to be precisely positioned in order to properly scan and download a
pilot's neural patterns. However, in Templar One (if you haven't figured
it out yet, you may want to consider reading this book if you have an
interest in deep EVE lore... but if you're looking for a (very) brief
over, see [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI53ydJaus8)), a
new conscience transfer technology is discovered. Found in Sleeper
ruins, the new implant offers the same basic functionality of the
old-style (I use the term loosely for something that humans won't invent
for another 21,000 years) transneural burning scanner, but with a number
of important differences. Perhaps the most important one is the range
limitation. Pod pilots, when killed, have their neural data sent via
quantum entangled atoms (I discuss the tech in greater detail below).
Because quantum entanglement has no obvious range limitations, a pod
pilot can be killed anywhere and still be resurrected, as long as they
are within their pod. Given how the mercenary implants work, however,
such a range is impossible. Thus, DUST mercenaries must be within a few
thousand kilometers of their Clone Reanimation Units (where the merc
respawns after death) in order to ensure that the data is transferred
correctly. But the changes go beyond that. As noted above, when pod
pilots die, their entire neural profile is transferred at the moment of
death and recreated in a new brain.

There was, however, something wrong with the implants. Well, not so much
wrong as much as they [were still
occupied](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/514_(Chronicle)). The
Amarr first stumbled across these implants while investigating Sleeper
ruins. They found intact, but seemingly dead, bodies and took them in to
study. They eventually discovered the implants discussed above, and what
they were able to do. However, the Amarr were unable to reproduce the
implants themselves. Faced with this unprecedented military technology,
they did what any God-fearing society would do: they resorted to grave
robbing. They soon culled hundreds, if not thousands, of these implants
and used them for their own purposes. The other empires (with a little
help from CONCORD and good ol' Directive Alpha Gamma 12) soon caught
wind of these programs, and set to work on their own research
initiatives, following the same grave-robbing techniques the Amarr first
pioneered.

The problem, of course, was that the Sleepers they were culling the
implants from weren't actually dead. They were simply living up to their
names: they were sleeping. The implants, apparently, not only serve to
transfer a conscience to a new body; they also help connect that
conscience to the Sleeper mainframe, as it were. When the implants were
removed from the Sleeper bodies, at least parts of the Sleeper
conscience remained in the implants. And it turns out they didn't much
appreciate being ripped out of their own bodies and used for the designs
of us lesser civilizations. They would briefly take over the new
mercenary soldiers, making them speak in tongues and have strange
visions.

The Amarr eventually recognized what was going on (indeed, Templar One
implies that the Empress is dealing with her own Sleeper conscience,
take from that what you will) and, with massive effort, managed to
create their own functionally equivalent implant technology. Seeing that
harvesting more of these implants could incur further wrath from the
Sleepers, Empress Jamyl [authorized each of the empires to have access
to her
alternative](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/514_(Chronicle)),
Sleeper-less implants. And thus, we head into the launch of DUST 514
with each empire having their own sets of immortal infantry, and
apparently free of the terrifying visions that hampered previous
incarnations of soldiers. Despite obvious advantages, it doesn't look
like capsuleers will be gaining access to this technology anytime soon.
Oh, and I should mention that I believe the same strict compatibility
requirements for capsuleers apply to the new implants.

Beyond that, the technology in DUST revolves around [guns, guns, and
more guns](http://www.dust514.org/item-database) (along with vehicles
that carry aforementioned guns). EVE Online players should recognize
some of the guns as miniaturized versions of our beloved space pew pew
modules, but there are sure to be new things out there. The Art
Department seems to have done an excellent job with keeping the themes
of each race. Gallente merc technology has that green, organic feel to
it, while at times it looks like Amarr mercs are clothed in pure gold. I
haven't seen much to indicate that, beyond the implant technology, there
will be much to revolutionize EVE technology. Still, the ability to
bombard planets back to the stone age from orbit ought to put a smile on
anyone's face.

One final note before I move on: CCP has made it clear that DUST 514
refers to something, but what specifically hasn't been quite spelled out
yet. I would guess that DUST (which, according to CCP, is meant to be
capitalized as such) is an acronym for something. And the [514
chronicle](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/514_(Chronicle)) states
that each soldier with the Sleeper implants had terrifying visions.
Visions of the number 514 written in blood... (Cue the Twilight Zone
music...)

Faster-Than-Light Communications
--------------------------------

FTL communication was actually developed significantly after the
development of FTL travel. Strangely, after FTL travel was developed, a
ship became the fastest way to spread information, a situation not
really seen since the great Age of Exploration on Earth before the
development of radio. As the interstellar community grew, some form of
communications proved necessary to allow communications across the
hundred light-years of New Eden. Many attempts were made to solve the
problem, and it was such a problem that even the ancient civilizations
seemed to [have their own
problems](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/hyperbole-nexus/)
with the concept. Some had hoped that the idea of entangled particles
(quarks and atoms that, through some quantum mechanical wizardry,
instantaneously respond to a stimulus on one of the tangled particles,
regardless of how many light years apart the two particles are) would
solve the problem. While this line of research seemed promising, no data
seemed to be able to be transmitted through entangled particles; only
[random
noise](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/FTL_communications#Stumbling_Blocks)
made it through the gauntlet of quantum statistical probability.

The breakthrough came from a young Gallente scientist, Li Azbel,
although she might well have been Minmatar given her solution. Her
solution is [complicated and filled with
technobabble](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/FTL_communications#Azbel.27s_Insight)
that would make a Trekkie proud, but it essentially comes down to using
that random noise to her advantage. Rather than transmitting data bit by
bit, she discovered she was able to modulate the amount and frequency of
the noise itself, which lead to being able to transmit data. With this
breakthrough (using useless junk to piggyback data onto), engineers were
quickly able to construct fluid routers made up of entangled particles.
These routers were soon joined into a [massive communications
network](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/FTL_communications_networks)
that today spans the cluster, and allows us now to contact any person
anywhere.

Stargates
---------

[Stargates](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Stargate) are the backbone
of New Eden, shaping the cluster and its politics as we know it. The
gate network snakes throughout New Eden, and today lets us cross over
100 light-years in just a few hours. Conceptual y, jumpgates are
actually fairly easy to understand: they're artificially created
wormholes that take you from one system to another. It's their
construction that mucks things up a bit.

As I mentioned during the Empires section, our modern stargates are
based on the wrecks and ruins of stargates originally built during the
first colonization of the Cluster (while we know the reason for the
fairly rapid colonization of the cluster, ingame scholars apparently
[continue to
debate](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Where_Do_We_Come_From.3F)
the reasons for it). The Amarr were the [first to
discover](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#The_Earliest_Jump_Gates_and_the_First_Interstellar_Travelers)
the near-perfect ruins of a gate in Amarr Prime, which let them fairly
easily reverse-engineer the working principles. The problem that they
ran into was that a single gate is not enough: it needs a partner. So
before the Amarr could activate the gate in their own system, they had
to send out ships filled with crews in [cryogenic
suspension](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Cryopreservation). The
ships would travel on their own for years or even decades until coming
to the new star system, at which point the crews are woken up and they
construct the companion gate. While most of the time these journeys
ended well, there have been some [very close
calls](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Old_Man_Star_(Chronicle)).
The discovery of jump drives only came about recently, and even today
there are dozens of ships heading out into the unknown to try to
construct the next set of gates.

Stargates can only work in certain locations. The artificial wormholes
are created at points [of gravitational
resonance](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Principles_of_Jump_Gate_Technology)
(essentially, where gravity waves can cancel each other out, like at
Lagrange points for the more scientifically inclined, or when you create
[a standing wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave)). At these
resonance points, the gravitational shear is so intense that it becomes
easy to just poke a hole through space-time. The hole doesn't
necessarily connect to anywhere at first, but if two gates are near each
other and told to activate at the same time, they Technobabble their way
into opening a wormhole between the systems every time you jump. CCP
made me a very happy camper by retconning that these stable
gravitational nodes can now be found on the edges of solar systems or
near planets of sufficient mass (originally, a stargate could only be in
a binary system and since that concept doesn't appear to exist in New
Eden astrography, it caused a bit of a headache for us lore nerds).
There's more maths and technobabble involved in the article linked to in
this paragraph for the people interested as well as *Eve Source*, but
suffice it to say that using a gate can be an uncomfortable experience
since, even with modern technology, you're still being stretched along a
pretty steep gravitational gradient.

Today, the technology of stargates have been miniaturized enough that
capital ships are able to create their own wormholes capable of carrying
themselves to nearby systems without the use of stargates, though the
use of a jump drive (this [jump
drive](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jump_drive) should NOT be
confused with the jump drive mentioned in the interstel ar travelling
article I've been linking. That 'jump drive' seems to be referring to
what we now call the warp drive). The general principle of the jump
drive seems to be the same as stargates, only now the use of cynosural
beacons allows the forming wormhole to easily latch onto something in
the destination system. Jump bridges work on a similar principle.

Warp Drive
----------

While on the notion of interstellar travel, I would be remiss if I
didn't mention the [warp
drive](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Warp_drives). Formally known as
the Sotiyo-Urbaata drive for the two Caldari scientists that developed
it, warp drives are the things that allow us to zoom around the solar
system at multiple astronomical units per second (as a reference guide,
it takes light approximately 8 minutes to travel 1 astronomical unit, so
traveling at the standard 3 AU per second is quite speedy indeed). First
developed in the year 22821, [the
drive](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Space_Vessels_Get_A_Boost:_The_First_Jump_Drives)
was built to solve the problem of how to quickly travel between Caldari
Prime and Gallente Prime. Even though developed over 600 years ago, the
Amarr and Minmatar took a while to catch on (the Minmatar had
independently developed acceleration gates for their intra-system travel
needs, the Amarr apparently just enjoy rocking back and forth and
slowness).

The warp drive works through the magic of "[depleted
vacuum](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Interstellar_travelling#Faster-Than-Light-Travel:_How.3F)."
Even empty space generally has SOMETHING in it, be it atoms here or
there or even just random particles that pop into existence only to be
annihilated mere moments later. So even the vacuum of space is never
truly "empty." The warp drive works to create full, "depleted" vacuum,
so there is literally nothing in it. No specks of dust, no [virtual
particles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle), no energy or
matter of any kind. Such an empty place, according to the game lore, has
special properties. Rather than being affected by friction, it actually
has anti-friction: things (including light) actually move faster in this
kind of space, rather than slower. By creating a depleted vacuum and
expanding the field to cover the entire ship, the ship then slips into
faster than light speeds as it [tunnels through
space](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Warp_tunnel). Navigation at FTL
speeds isn't easy; the ship can only detect gravitational sources at
warp speeds. When the drive is activated, it locks onto a sufficiently
massive object (even stations can do) that acts as a beacon, so the
drive knows when to cut out. The need to lock onto a gravity source to
activate the drive is the nominal reason why you can't just pick a
random direction and warp off, but doesn't quite explain how we can just
warp to bookmarks in the middle of nowhere (but WHATEVER). Furthermore,
you can blame your warp core (essentially, an [aneutronic fusion
reactor](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion) coupled
with the depleted vacuum generator) for creating "[four dimensional
drag](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Storylines_of_New_Eden_-_11th_February)"
that pulls your ship to a halt (this is ostensibly why we play
submarines in space (from a physics model perspective), as opposed to
the Newtonian motion that we would see in real life).

Vitoc
-----

It's hard to control slaves. They tend to not enjoy the experience. It
was a lot easier to control slaves before they learned to read (since
reading allows radical ideas like "hey, let's not be slaves anymore" to
be easily transmitted throughout a slave community), but in order for
most slaves to be useful in this day and age, the ability to read and
write is basically required. So as time went on, the Amarr had to
develop more advanced techniques to control their slaves. One of the
more devilish techniques they developed was the use of vitoxin and its
antidote, vitoc.

The methods have varied over the years, but the underlying concept is
the same: inject the slave with a
[toxin](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Vitoc_Problem) that will
kill the slave (in, of course, the [most gruesome and painful
way](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Vitoc_Problem#Symptoms_of_Vitoxin)
possible) unless an antidote is injected every day or two. That antidote
is vitoc. To make matters worse, vitoc was also created to be [extremely
addicting](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Vitoc_Problem#Mechanisms_of_Vitoc),
producing intense states of euphoria after it is injected. Thus, even if
there were a way to remove the toxin from the slave, they'd still find
themselves intensely addicted to the substance. In the modern era, the
Amarr have swapped to using a virus that ultimately produces the deadly
vitoxin. The Amarr use this to control their slaves, threatening to
withhold the vitoc if they do not follow orders.

Various attempts have been made to [fight
vitoxin](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Vitoxin_Cure) and vitoc
addiction over the years. One of the most promising cures,
[Insorum](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Insorum), was developed by
Ishukone. [Otro
Gariushi](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Otro_Gariushi), Ishukone's
former CEO, gave the antidote's formula to the Minmatar free of charge
(apparently enraging the mysterious
[Broker](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Broker) in the process,
who had been bidding on it), and it is now part of the standard
treatment regimen. However, research into other cures, both scientific
and holistic, continues. One of the primary centers for vitoc research
can be found in Yrmori, at the [Forlorn
Hope](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/12/10/forlorn-hope/) institute
(which is admittedly not the first name I would have picked for an
optimistic "yes, we can beat this thing" research institute), though a
full cure for the toxin and addiction have yet to present themselves.

Miscellaneous
=============

There's just a few things left that I want to touch on, and then I
PROMISE I'll stop writing. These are things that either seemed to fit
either everywhere, or nowhere at all, so I figured it would just be
easiest to separate them out into their own little category.

Calendar
--------

I realize that I swap a lot between saying years in the traditional AD
system and in the newer YC system, but I'm working off of what the
timeline gives me. It's easier to keep it set that way rather than
referring to YC -18,000, which just seems sil y to me. In any case, I
just wanted to make a brief note on the timekeeping system used in New
Eden. [YC](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/YC) refers to the Yoiul
Convention, a timekeeping system established aboard the Jove ship
*Yoiul* in 23236 AD. The new calendar, which is used to transact all
space-based business, was established to simplify things when time is of
the essence (since each empire had developed their own calendars based
on each planet's own length of year and length of day). Through complete
accident (I'm sure), one of the few things Amarr scripture [preserved
from the very early days of
settlement](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Transitional_Era_of_the_Amarr_Empire#Youil_Conference)
just *happened* to be our classic Gregorian calendar, down to what day
corresponds to January 1, leap years, and when midnight happens. Those
crazy Amarr.

When the time came to negotiate a universal time system, there were [a
number of
factions](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Time_and_the_Astrologer_(Chronicle))
advocating different calendars. Some wanted a completely physics-based
calendar, based on some celestial source. Others wanted to set the clock
to the human body's natural 25 hour clock. And the last set, known as
the traditionalists, wanted to align New Eden's calendar with the
ancient timekeeping systems that researchers reconstructed. Obviously,
the traditionalists won out in the end, and YC 0 was celebrated
throughout New Eden on January 1, 23236 AD. We continue to use the
system to this day. As noted in the introduction, the real life year of
2012 corresponds to the in-game year of YC 114.

Naming Conventions / Languages
------------------------------

One of the things I wanted to touch on was how to set up appropriate
names for the bloodlines. Most of the bloodlines developed on completely
separate worlds, and as such, they developed their own languages through
the Dark Ages, and they continue to use those languages today. Of
course, from an in-game perspective, the use of different languages
doesn't matter thanks to the development [of translation
software](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Language_Translators_(Chronicle))
in our ships (though why local remains untranslated remains an open
question). Regardless, crafting appropriate sounding names is an
important aspect to most RPers, so I've included a brief review of most
in-game languages and names. I should mention that most of this research
was done by my host Seismic Stan in the course of preparing his
excellent in-character website at [Tech4 News](http://tech4news.org/),
which is dedicated to covering news from a non-capsuleer perspective,
though there are [other excellent player-researched
sources](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&m=184211#post184211)
out there.

Before I dig into these, I want to again mention that these should only
be seen as very general guidelines. In modern day New Eden, cultures are
mixing like never before, meaning that there is no particular reason why
a Gallente couldn't have an Amarr sounding name, or vice versa. And, of
course, given that our own planet has developed hundreds of languages
over the course of human existence, these rules are by no means the only
ways to create names.

**Amarr:** Little is known about the native [Amarr
language](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Amarrian_language), and what
little we do know can seem at times contradictory (though that hasn't
stopped some intrepid players from attempting to put together a [more
comprehensive
language](http://backstage.eve-inspiracy.com/index.php?topic=1078.0)).
Still, it appears that True Amarr names often have a Persian or even
Farsi feel to them (somewhat oddly, given their Catholic origins), while
Khanid seems to have a more Mongolian background to it. I unfortunately
wasn't able to find any information on the Ni-Kunni.

**Minmatar:** Given the tribal background of the Minmatar, it should be
unsurprising that language probably varies from tribe to tribe, though
since they all developed on the same world (originally), there's
probably also a unified Matari language. That being said, there's still
some patterns apparent in the various tribal names. The Brutors tend to
have a Maori feel to them, while the Sebestior (somewhat randomly) seem
to be derived from Nordic names. The Vherekior seem to derive from Urdu
names.

**Gallente:** As might be expected, the Gallente language and names seem
to derive mostly from French roots, with perhaps a Gallic influence to
them. The Jin-Mei, meanwhile, seem to have Chinese-derived names. The
Intaki language, derived from Indian origins (though with obvious French
influences), is a bit special. The language has been surprisingly
well-developed by RP groups, to the extent that
[entire](http://www.ilfcorp.com/index.php/language-vaanin-kintaki-lexicon)
[pages](http://www.ilfcorp.com/index.php/language-vaanin-kintaki) have
been dedicated to the language. To my knowledge, no other in-game
language has been developed to such an extent, but if that's incorrect,
please feel free to let me know.

**Caldari:** We've only seen snippets of the [Caldari
language](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Caldari_Language) in the
Prime Fiction (helpfully aggregated
[here](http://fourthdistrict.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1172)). What
little we've seen suggests a combination of Finnish and Japanese
influences, however.

Seyllin Incident/Isogen-5
-------------------------

There's one last topic to discuss before concluding. It's a slightly odd
topic, in that it is both integral to the overall EVE storyline these
days, but also somewhat self-contained compared to the rest of the
story. I'm talking, of course, about wormholes and the fateful day that
they first opened to us citizens of New Eden.

[March 10, YC 111](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Year_YC111_March)
started as an ordinary day, but it certainly didn't end like one. Before
the day was out, 10 separate Class-O stars across the Cluster
simultaneously suffered what astronomers have rather boringly termed
"[main sequence events](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q62Wk3xWH8g)." In
reality, these "events" were massive explosions, creating coronal mass
ejections that were powerful enough to destroy the first planets in
these systems. The broken husks of these [shattered
planets](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/shattered-planets/)
can be seen even today in these various systems (Rhavas has done an
excellent and in-depth study of all known shattered planets in his
[Shattered Planet
Datacore](http://interstellarprivateer.wordpress.com/shattered-planets-datacore/)).
Of course, anything merely man-made had little chance of surviving
events that could destroy planets. While a number of systems were
thankfully uninhabited, we do know that an Intaki Syndicate station was
destroyed, as well as a Thukker caravan in the Great Wildlands.

These losses pale in comparison, though, to the loss of life in Seyllin.
Seyllin was a small but successful Federation mining colony housing
roughly 500 million people on it. Troubles first arose when the local
[solar monitoring
satellites](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Cassandra) dropped out of
contact, followed by the colony itself a few minutes later. This was due
to the massive electromagnetic pulse that essentially flash-fried any
inhabitants on the sunward side of [Seyllin
I](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Seyllin_I). However, a significant
number of citizens were on the dark side of the planet, protected from
the pulse by the planet's sheer bulk. It took a while for both the
Federation and others [to figure out precisely what was going
on](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/World_On_Fire_(Chronicle)),
wasting precious moments that could have been used to evacuate citizens
from the doomed planet. Finally, the Federation Navy, assisted by the
Sisters of EVE and other factions, managed to begin lifting some
citizens, but not nearly enough. Only 843,000 out of a population of 500
million were ultimately saved from Seyllin I.

After such an event, of course, governments and scientists alike were
eager to determine just what caused these "events." Eventually, the
signature of a rare substance known as
[Isogen-5](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Isogen-5) was found at the
site of each explosion. Isogen-5, a rare isotope of the somewhat more
common [Isogen](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Isogen), is an
extremely unstable substance (if that wasn't obvious from the, you know,
massive explosions it caused). We're not entirely sure who or what
placed the Isogen-5 near the stars, but

[there's](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Spiral_(Chronicle))

[least](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/1_(Chronicle))
[one](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Great_Harvest_(Chronicle))
[proven](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/We_Humans_(Chronicle))
[case](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/World_On_Fire_(Chronicle))
(though not one that's known publicly, to my knowledge) where rogue
drones were hoarding the substance for unknown reasons. In that case,
however, rogue drones were hoarding the Isogen-5 apparently under the
command of Empress Jamyl (who had yet to make [her
return](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Jamyl_I#Return_and_Battle_of_Mekhios)
to Cluster politics following her apparent death), to power the Terran
superweapon that she used to devastating effect in the [Battle of
Mekhios](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2009/12/23/40/) against the
Elder Fleet. Prior to her return, she tested her superweapon once on a
[Blood
Raider](http://evetravel.wordpress.com/2011/02/12/t-ipzb-graveyard/)
fleet, with a similar result. There is at least [some
evidence](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Storylines_of_New_Eden_-_11th_February)
that the March 10 detonations were, in fact, an accident. Under this
theory, one of the Isogen-5 caches made by the drones under Jamyl's
command accidentally detonated, which set off a chain reaction amongst
the other Isogen-5 caches. However, that theory doesn't quite explain
why some shattered planets are found in wormhole space (where New Eden
rogue drones couldn't possibly have traveled to before the wormholes
opened), so the question of who created the caches in the first place is
still very much up for debate (as is the question of rogue drone motives
for creating their caches).

In any event, the Isogen-5 detonations did more than just kill a few
hundred million people. The explosions were so severe that they ripped
holes in the fabric of space-time. Apparently random
[wormholes](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Wormhole) soon appeared
throughout the cluster. Intriguingly, out of the trillions upon
trillions of stars in the universe that the wormholes could lead to,
they all lead to about 2,500 that are inhabited in some capacity by the
Sleepers (the reasons for why wormholes only lead to these select
systems is unknown). These systems, known as
[Anoikis](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Anoikis_(Chronicle))
(Anoikis and w-space are equivalent terms, but I believe there's a
slight preference in RP circles to call it Anoikis), are located in an
unknown area of space (though *Templar One* does mention that the only
identifiable objects in Anoikis are quasars, which would make Anoikis
incredibly distant from New Eden). However, within hours of the first
wormhole opening in
[Vitrauze](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/The_Vitrauze_Project_(Chronicle)),
the Gallente were sending ships through. Soon, the empires and CONCORD
all [agreed](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Vitrauze_Agreement) to
buy certain items taken from Sleeper salvage at a standardized rate.
Sleeper salvage led to a number of technological advances, including
Tech 3 strategic cruisers and the technology needed to create the
immortal soldiers in the soon-to-be-released game Dust 514. Needless to
say, research on Isogen-5, Anoikis, and related areas is [still
ongoing](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Arek%27Jaalan) (including a
[project](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Project_Compass) by yours
truly!). How all these pieces truly fit together may never entirely be
known, unfortunately.

Conclusion
==========

Well, that about wraps it up. I confess that after writing all of this,
I'm ironically not entirely sure of the best way to conclude. Some
grandiose statement on the interconnectedness and depth of New Eden's
story seems appropriate, but it turns out that Seismic Stan already said
everything I could on the subject and more in his excellent foreword.
But one of the things this project has taught me is that the best way to
learn the lore is to really dig into it yourself. I took pains while
writing this to cross-reference to the bigger articles on the lore, but
there's still so much out there that I just didn't have time or room to
talk about. Dig into it, and you can see the kind of story CCP has built
for Eve. At the risk of sounding clichÃ©, there's a universe worth of
stories out there to discover.

I will say that EVE has a fantastic backstory though, and the best part
is that it's still being written. Whether it be the political intrigues
of New Eden's null security alliances, discovering more about our past
history, or the next scandal or crisis to hit the empires, the story of
EVE lives and grows every day. It's one of many great things about a
great game, and I had a blast putting this guide together and digging
back into the lore.

I'd like to thank Seismic Stan for letting me take over his blog for a
few days to post the blogpost version, as well as instigating this guide
in the first place. He acted as a constant sounding board whenever I
needed it (much to the detriment to his sleeping schedule), and his
suggestions and editing proved invaluable. And all of that says nothing
of the promotional help he gave or how he dealt with me making hundreds
of updates to the Guide. I can't possibly thank him enough. And I must
thank Morwen Lagann for acting as my second set of lore-familiar eyes on
this, making sure I didn't commit some grievous RP faux pas. I'd also
like to thank the EVE Content Teams, past and present, that really made
this possible. Without dedicated lore people such as CCP TonyG, Abraxus,
Dropbear, and the others on the Lore team, this kind of project never
would have been possible (nor, for that matter, would a 13,000 entry
wiki). This Guide was as much a way to showcase their painstaking work
on this as it was to summarize it, and I can't give them enough credit
for the fantastic universe that they've created. If you guys have any
questions or comments, don't hesitate to contact me in game or out of
game.
