# Mark726's EVE Lore Survival Guide

This is a Markdown/ePub version of Mark726's EVE Lore Survival Guide,  
found at https://evetravel.wordpress.com/lore-survival-guide/

**I AM NOT THE AUTHOR OF THIS TEXT, all credit goes to [Mark726](https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Mark726) from [EVE Travel](https://evetravel.wordpress.com/)!**

I wanted to read his great EVE lore guide on my mobile phone, but the PDF version was not very comfortable
to read on the small screen. Since there was no current E-Book version of the text available (only an old v1.3),
I decided to create one myself.

I converted the [PDF](https://evetravel.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/mark726s-eve-lore-survival-guide-v-2-1-no-pics.pdf)
into the both machine- and human-readable [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, so I could use
[Pandoc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandoc) to create an ePub from it according to
[this guide](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/epub.html).

You can read the Markdown version online [here](https://github.com/flesser/mark726-eve-lore-ebook/blob/master/mark726s-eve-lore-survival-guide-v-2-1.md) and [download the E-book here](https://github.com/flesser/mark726-eve-lore-ebook/blob/master/ePub/mark726s-eve-lore-survival-guide-v-2-1.epub?raw=true) (ePub format).
